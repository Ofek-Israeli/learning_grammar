Total length: 75457 characters.: \n\n## Question\nIs growth in JnJ's adjusted EPS expected to accelerate in FY2023?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 75457 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if growth in Johnson & Johnson's adjusted EPS is expected to accelerate in FY2023, focus on extracting specific financial projections and statements related to earnings per share (EPS) from the document. Look for any forward-looking statements or guidance provided by the company regarding their EPS for FY2023. Pay attention to any comparisons made with previous years' EPS growth rates, as these will indicate whether an acceleration is anticipated. Additionally, examine any commentary from the management or financial analysts that discusses expected performance drivers or market conditions that could impact EPS growth. This information will be critical in assessing whether an acceleration in EPS growth is projected for FY2023."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have gathered the following key information:\n\n1. **Guidance for FY2023**: Johnson & Johnson's adjusted operational EPS for FY2023 is guided to be $10.50, reflecting a growth rate of 3.5%. This is confirmed by multiple chunks (Chunk ID: 0 and Chunk ID: 3).\n\n2. **Growth Rate Range**: The expected growth rate for the adjusted operational EPS is between 2.5% and 4.5%, with a midpoint of 3.5% (Chunk ID: 3).\n\n3. **Lack of Additional Context**: Many chunks did not provide additional forward-looking statements or comparisons with previous years' EPS growth rates.\n\nTo determine if the growth in J&J's adjusted EPS is expected to accelerate in FY2023, we need to compare the 3.5% growth rate with the growth rate from the previous year. However, the outputs do not provide the previous year's growth rate, which is crucial for making this comparison.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- **Sufficiency**: The information is not sufficient to definitively answer whether the growth is accelerating because we lack the previous year's EPS growth rate for comparison.\n- **Missing Information**: We need the adjusted EPS growth rate for FY2022 to determine if the 3.5% growth in FY2023 represents an acceleration.\n- **Next Steps**: If possible, retrieve the previous year's EPS growth rate from additional documents or data sources to complete the analysis. If the previous year's growth rate is lower than 3.5%, then we can conclude that the growth is accelerating. If it is higher, then it is not accelerating."

      "output": "Based on the collected information, we have gathered that Johnson & Johnson's adjusted operational EPS for FY2023 is guided to be $10.50, reflecting a growth rate of 3.5%. The expected growth rate range is between 2.5% and 4.5%. Additionally, the adjusted EPS (Diluted) is expected to be between $10.45 and $10.65, with a mid-point of $10.55, reflecting a growth rate range of 3.0% to 5.0%.\n\nTo determine if the growth in J&J's adjusted EPS is expected to accelerate in FY2023, we need to compare this growth rate with the previous year's growth rate. However, the previous year's growth rate is not provided in the collected outputs. Without this information, we cannot definitively determine whether the growth is accelerating.\n\nIn summary, the information gathered is not sufficient to answer the question because we lack the previous year's EPS growth rate. To answer the question, we need the EPS growth rate for the prior fiscal year to compare it with the projected growth rate for FY2023. If the previous year's growth rate is lower than 3.5%, then we could conclude that the growth is accelerating. If it is higher, then the growth is decelerating."
