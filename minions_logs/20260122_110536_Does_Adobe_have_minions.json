Total length: 376493 characters.: \n\n## Question\nDoes Adobe have an improving Free cashflow conversion as of FY2022?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 376493 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if Adobe has an improving free cash flow conversion as of FY2022, focus on extracting specific financial metrics from the document. Look for the free cash flow figures for FY2022 and compare them to previous fiscal years to assess any improvement. Examine the cash flow statements to identify trends in operating cash flow and capital expenditures, as these components are crucial for calculating free cash flow. Additionally, review any management commentary or analysis sections that discuss cash flow performance and strategic initiatives impacting cash flow. Pay attention to any notes on changes in working capital, as these can significantly affect cash flow conversion."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins \nand could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. \nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, \nintroduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, \nextend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery \nmethods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet \nand mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue \nadapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than \nus, our business could be harmed.

As a result of \nthese advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of \nour market share.

We are closely monitoring for \ndevelopments related to valid transfer mechanisms available for transferring personal data outside the European Economic Area \n(including the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework) and other countries that have similar trans-border data flow \nrequirements and adjusting our practices accordingly. The open judicial questions and regulatory interpretations related to the \nvalidity of transfers using Standard Contractual Clauses have resulted in some changes in the obligations required to provide \nour services in the European Union and could expose us to potential sanctions and fines for non-compliance. Several other \ncountries, including China, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Hong Kong and Japan, have also established specific legal \nrequirements for cross-border transfers of personal information and for data localization (i.e., where personal data must remain \nstored in the country). If other countries implement more restrictive regulations for cross-border data transfers or do not permit \ndata to leave the country of origin, such developments could adversely impact our business and our enterprise customers’ \nbusiness, our financial condition and our results of operations in those jurisdictions.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset and we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, \nincluding our source code, from infringement or unauthorized copying, use or disclosure.\nOur intellectual property portfolio is a valuable asset.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF \nOPERATIONS \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. \nDiscussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 is included in \nItem 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 3, 2021, filed with the SEC on January 21, \n2022.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations \nof the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and \nexpenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on \nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the \nBoard of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are \nkey components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and \nconsequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud \nservices are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from \neach other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the \non-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription \nofferings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the \nsubscription period for which the cloud services ",

In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our \npromise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or \ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams.

The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost \nbuild-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. \nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, \nestimates or actual results.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is \nrecognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of \nassets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our \ncurrent provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax \nassets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our \ninterpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by \ndomestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving \ntax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these \nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final \ndetermination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting \npronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. \nACQUISITIONS \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a \ncloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital \nMedia reportable segment.

Starting in December 2021, Creative Cloud includes Adobe Express, a web and mobile application designed to \nenable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit \nand customize content quickly and easily with content-first, task-based solutions.

We expect Creative Cloud will drive sustained \nlong-term revenue growth through a continued expansion of our customer base by attracting new users with new features and \nproducts like Adobe Express that make creative tools accessible to first-time creators and communicators, and delivering new \nfeatures and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases such as share for review. We have also built out a \nmarketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. \nOverall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new \ncustomers, and grow our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of \nsubscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such \nas offering new desktop, web and mobile applications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and \npotential users to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud.

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is \nearned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do \nbusiness, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those \ncovered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, \ncould make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. \nThese countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some \ncases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been \ninterpreted and applied.

As we \nrepatriate foreign earnings for use in the United States, the distributions will generally be exempt from federal income taxes. In \naddition, the U.S. Tax Act requires companies to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures starting fiscal \n2023. If not modified, we anticipate an adverse impact to our effective rates for income taxes paid, which will be partially offset \nby the increase in the foreign-derived intangible income deduction, for fiscal 2023 and beyond.\nTable of Contents\n48\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act enacted on August 16, 2022 introduced new provisions including a corporate book \nminimum tax effective for us beginning in fiscal 2024 and an excise tax on net stock repurchases made after December 31, \n2022. We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of these provisions to our results of operations and \ncash flows.\nStock Repurchase Program\nTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from \nstock issuances, we may repurchase our shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third \nparties. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock \nthrough the end of fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including approximately 10.4 million shares at an \naverage price of $375.03 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, as well as \n5.3 million shares at an average purchase price of $451.55 through an accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into \nduring the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial \ninstitution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1.75 billion. As of December 2, 2022, $583 million of \nprepayment remained under our outstanding structured stock repurchase agreement.\nSubsequent to December 2, 2022, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into an \naccelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of  \n$1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. \nUpon completion of the $1.4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $5.15 billion remains under our December 2020 \nauthority.\nSee section titled “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity \nSecurities” in Part II, Item 5 of this report for stock repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2022 and Note 14 of \nour Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further",

Historically, costs related to these \nindemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these \nindemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\nTo the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for \ncertain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification \nperiod covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime. The maximum potential amount of \nfuture payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director \nand officer insurance coverage that reduces our exposure and enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid.\nTable of Contents\n49\n\n\nITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAll market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.\nForeign Currency Risk\nForeign Currency Exposures and Hedging Instruments\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us \nto exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a \nportion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized \nforeign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and \ncash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nOur significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nEuro\n€ \n2,487 € \n2,209 € \n1,887 \nJapanese Yen\n¥ \n118,456 ¥ \n104,829 ¥ \n88,640 \nBritish Pounds\n£ \n737 £ \n669 £ \n562 \nAustralian Dollars\n$ \n876 $ \n768 $ \n645 \nAs of December 2, 2022, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and \nforwards, were $3.25 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $1.32 billion in Euros, $602 million in Indian Rupees, \n$480 million in British Pounds, $394 million in Japanese Yen, $338 million in Australian Dollars and $112 million in other \nforeign currencies.

In addition, we enter into collateral security \nagreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from \ncontractually established thresholds.\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 2, 2022. This sensitivity \nanalysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. \nDollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar \nand a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our \nfinancial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the \nfair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in \ncountries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the \nlocal currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization \nand retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and \nDecember 3, 2021, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million and $749 \nmillion, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency \nexposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging \nprogram and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\nCash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Expenses\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in \nEuros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We hedge these \ncash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nThese foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign \nexchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not \nspeculative in nature.\nWe record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in \naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs.",

For the fiscal year ended December 2, 2022, there were no net gains or \nlosses recognized in revenue or operating expenses relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.\nNon-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities\nOur derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily \nuse to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and \ncash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are \ncarried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated \nStatements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities.

Changes in interest \nrates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our short-term \ninvestment portfolio as of December 2, 2022, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio \nthat would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a \n$20 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates \nwould lead to a $20 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and \ntherefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 2, 2022, the \ntotal carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less \nactive markets was $3.88 billion.\nSee Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.\nTable of Contents\n51\n\n\nITEM 8.

We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules \nand regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the \nrules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad \ndebts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, litigation and income \ntaxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal \n2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal \n2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, \nroyalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and \ntechnical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised \nproducts or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those \nproducts or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n58\n\n\ncapable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation.

Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral \ncancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase \nother Adobe products or services.\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without \ntaking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or \nbased on consumption or usage.\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed \nnumber of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on \nthe date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through \nthe end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in \naccordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable \nconsideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer \nbenefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions \nsold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes \nthe benefit of the underlying service.\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is \nrecognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription \nrevenues represent stand-ready performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably \nover their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or \nbased on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements.

We typically sell our consulting \ncontracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-\nmaterials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts.

In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our \npromise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or \ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams.

Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they \nare sold and what channel they are sold through.

We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, \nincluding contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products.

In addition, distributors are allowed to return \nproducts that have reached the end of their lives, as defined by us, and for products that are being replaced by new versions. We \noffer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. Transaction price is reduced for these amounts based on \nactual performance against objectives set forth by us for a particular reporting period, such as volume and timely reporting. \nOn a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on our historical trends and data specific \nto each reporting period. The primary method of establishing these reserves is to review historical data from prior periods as a \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n60\n\n\npercent of revenue to determine a historical reserve rate.

In certain of our lease arrangements, \nprimarily those related to our data center arrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract contains a lease. For \nthese arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if the arrangement involves an identified asset that is physically distinct or \nwhether we have the right to substantially all of the capacity of an identified asset that is not physically distinct. In \narrangements that involve an identified asset, there is also judgment in evaluating if we have the right to direct the use of that \nasset. \nWe do not have any finance leases. Operating leases are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use \n(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining \nlease payments over the lease term, determined using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. Because the rate \nimplicit in our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, which \napproximates the interest rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in \nsimilar economic environments. As of December 2, 2022, our leases had remaining lease terms of up to 9 years, some of which \nincluded options to extend the lease for up to 14 years and options to terminate the lease within 1 year. Optional periods to \nextend the lease, including by not exercising a termination option, are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain \nthat the option will be exercised. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Operating lease expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components, principally common area maintenance \nfor our facilities leases, as a single lease component for our facilities and data center leases. \nIn accordance with accounting requirements, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are recorded on the balance \nsheet, with lease expense for these leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis.

We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that \nare billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based \nroyalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint. \nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and \nnon-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above \ncomprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining \nperformance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the \nnext 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \ncosts to be longer than one year.

Within these documents, I would focus on the financial statements (e.g., balance sheet and income statement) and cash flow statements. Management commentary sections often provide context and insights into a company's financial performance and cash flow generation. If this document excerpt were part of a larger annual report or 10-K filing, I would search for these sections to find relevant information."

      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have gathered some key pieces of information regarding Adobe's free cash flow for FY2022 and previous years:\n\n1. **Free Cash Flow Figures**: \n   - FY2022: $6.268 billion (Chunk ID: 71)\n   - FY2021: $3.697 billion (Chunk ID: 71)\n   - FY2020: $2.313 billion (Chunk ID: 71)\n\n2. **Cash Flows from Operations**:\n   - FY2022: $7.84 billion (Chunk ID: 64)\n   - FY2021: $7.23 billion (Chunk ID: 64)\n\n3. **Management Commentary**: \n   - There is a mention of a decrease in free cash flow from $10.1 billion in FY2021 to $6.4 billion in FY2022 (Chunk ID: 1). However, this seems to conflict with the figures provided in Chunk ID: 71.\n\n4. **Calculation Method**: \n   - Free cash flow is typically calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from cash flow from operations. This method is mentioned in several chunks, but specific capital expenditure figures are not consistently provided.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **Sufficiency**: The information is somewhat conflicting, particularly between the free cash flow figures provided in Chunk ID: 71 and the management commentary in Chunk ID: 1. However, the figures from Chunk ID: 71 are more detailed and provide a consistent view across multiple years, which suggests they might be more reliable.\n\n- **Missing Information**: We lack consistent capital expenditure figures to independently verify the free cash flow calculations. Additionally, the conflicting management commentary needs clarification.\n\n- **Conclusion**: Based on the figures from Chunk ID: 71, Adobe's free cash flow has improved from FY2020 to FY2021 and further into FY2022. However, due to conflicting information, further verification from the original financial statements or management commentary would be necessary to confirm this trend definitively.\n\n- **Next Steps**: To resolve the conflict, it would be beneficial to access the full financial statements or management discussion sections from Adobe's 10-K filings for FY2022 and previous years to verify the free cash flow figures and understand the context of the management commentary."

The complexity in these sales cycles is due \nto several factors, including:\n•\nthe need for our sales representatives to educate customers about the use and benefit of large-scale deployments of \nour products and services;\n•\nthe desire of organizations to undertake significant evaluation processes to determine their technology requirements \nprior to making information technology expenditures and the need for our representatives to spend a significant \namount of time assisting with such evaluations;\n•\nintensifying competition within the industry; \n•\nthe negotiation of large, complex, enterprise-wide contracts;\n•\nthe need for our customers to obtain requisition approvals from various decision makers within their organizations \ndue to the complexity of our solutions touching multiple departments; and\n•\ncustomer budget constraints, economic conditions and unplanned administrative delays.\nWe spend substantial time and expense on our sales efforts without assurance that potential customers will ultimately \npurchase our solutions. As we target our sales efforts at larger enterprise customers, these trends are expected to continue and \ncould have a greater impact on our results of operations.

This is especially the case when the third party’s offerings are integrated with our \nproducts and services, or where the third party’s offerings are difficult to substitute or replace. Alternative arrangements for \nsuch products and services may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, and we may experience business \ninterruptions upon a transition to an alternative partner.

This debt may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results by, among other things: \n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions;\n•\nrequiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flows from operations to service our debt, thereby \nreducing the amount of expected cash flows available for other purposes, including capital expenditures and \nacquisitions; and\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry.\nOur senior unsecured notes and senior unsecured credit agreement impose restrictions on us and require us to maintain \ncompliance with specified covenants. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. \nIf we breach any of the covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the noteholders or lenders, then, subject to applicable cure \nperiods, any outstanding debt may be declared immediately due and payable.\nIn addition, changes by any rating agency to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our \ndebt and equity securities, as well as the potential costs associated with a refinancing of our debt. Under certain circumstances, \nif our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken, the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit \nfacility could increase.

The transfers did not result in taxable gains; however, our Irish \nsubsidiary recognized deferred tax assets for the book and tax basis difference of the transferred IP rights.

This sensitivity \nanalysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. \nDollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar \nand a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our \nfinancial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the \nfair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in \ncountries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the \nlocal currency denominated operating expenses.

We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Operating lease expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components, principally common area maintenance \nfor our facilities leases, as a single lease component for our facilities and data center leases. \nIn accordance with accounting requirements, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are recorded on the balance \nsheet, with lease expense for these leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-\nrefundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or a",

Performance share \nawards are included based on the number of shares that would be issued as if the end of the reporting period was the end of the \nperformance period and the result was dilutive.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020:\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nNet income\n$ \n4,756 $ \n4,822 $ \n5,260 \nShares used to compute basic net income per share\n \n469.5  \n477.3  \n480.9 \nDilutive potential common shares from stock plans and programs\n \n1.4  \n3.7  \n4.6 \nShares used to compute diluted net income per share\n \n470.9  \n481.0  \n485.5 \nBasic net income per share\n$ \n10.13 $ \n10.10 $ \n10.94 \nDiluted net income per share\n$ \n10.10 $ \n10.02 $ \n10.83 \nAnti-dilutive potential common shares\n \n4.2  \n0.2  \n0.5 \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n84\n\n\nNOTE 16.

      "output": "Based on the collected outputs, we have gathered some information about Adobe's cash flow performance, but there are significant gaps and inconsistencies. Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Information Gathered**:\n   - Free cash flow figures for FY2022 and previous years were not directly extracted from the document. However, some chunks provided related data such as cash flows from operations and net changes in cash and cash equivalents.\n   - Operating cash flow for FY2022 was reported as $7.84 billion, an increase from $7.23 billion in FY2021.\n   - Management commentary on cash flow performance was sparse, with some mentions of strategic initiatives and risks affecting cash flow.\n   - Notes on changes in working capital affecting cash flow were not explicitly found, but some inferences were made regarding deferred revenue and trade receivables.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - The information is not sufficient to definitively answer whether Adobe has an improving free cash flow conversion as of FY2022. While we have some data on operating cash flow, we lack explicit free cash flow figures and detailed capital expenditures data needed to calculate free cash flow conversion.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - Explicit free cash flow figures for FY2022 and previous years.\n   - Detailed capital expenditures data to calculate free cash flow.\n   - Comprehensive management commentary on cash flow performance and strategic initiatives impacting cash flow.\n\n4. **Calculation/Derivation**:\n   - If we had the missing data, we could calculate free cash flow as operating cash flow minus capital expenditures. Free cash flow conversion would then be assessed by comparing free cash flow to net income or revenue over the years.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - There are conflicting interpretations regarding cash flow performance, with some chunks suggesting improvement and others indicating potential risks. Without explicit free cash flow data, it's challenging to resolve these conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are indications of increased operating cash flow, the lack of explicit free cash flow figures and comprehensive management commentary prevents a definitive answer to the question. Further detailed financial data and analysis would be required to assess Adobe's free cash flow conversion accurately."

Any of these factors could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margins \nand could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross-sell rates, as well as our ability to attract new customers. \nOur future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing products and services, \nintroduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner, meet changing customer expectations and needs, \nextend our core technology into new applications, and anticipate emerging standards, business models, software delivery \nmethods and other technological developments. For example, consumers continue to migrate from personal computers to tablet \nand mobile devices and from desktop to the web. While we offer our products on a variety of platforms, if we cannot continue \nadapting our products to tablet and mobile devices or the web, or if our competitors can adapt their products more quickly than \nus, our business could be harmed. In addition, releases of new devices or operating systems may make it more difficult for our \nproducts to perform or may require significant cost to adapt our solutions. The potential costs and delays incurred as a result \ncould harm our business. If we fail to anticipate or misjudge customers’ rapidly changing needs and expectations or adapt to \nemerging technological trends, our market share and results of operations could suffer.\nFurthermore, some of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater financial, \ntechnical, sales, marketing and other resources, broader brand awareness and access to larger customer bases. As a result of \nthese advantages, potential and current customers might select the products and services of our competitors, causing a loss of \nour market share. Our competitors, including large enterprises, may develop products, features or services that are similar to \nours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or \nmarketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies.\nFor additional information regarding our competition and the risks arising out of the competitive environment in which \nwe operate, see the section title",

We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on \nhistorical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could \ndiffer materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the \nBoard of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. These areas are \nkey components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and estimates, and \nconsequently, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition \nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services. Determining whether the software licenses and the cloud \nservices are distinct from each other, and therefore performance obligations to be accounted for separately, or not distinct from \neach other, and therefore part of a single performance obligation, may require significant judgment. We have concluded that the \non-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription \nofferings are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the \nsubscription period for which the cloud services ",

In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our \npromise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or \ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing \naccess to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, \nprovide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device \nsoftware or cloud services on their own.\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with \nthe on-premise/on-device software include, but are not limited to: Creative Cloud Libraries, which enable customers to access \ntheir work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices and collaborate across teams in \nreal time; shared reviews which enable simultaneous editing and commenting of digital assets across desktop, mobile and web; \nautomatic cloud rendering of a design which enables it to be worked on in multiple mediums; and Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted \nartificial intelligence and machine learning framework, which enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph \ncontent-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed \nbased upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation process requires management to \nmake significant estimates and assumptions with respect to intangible assets and deferred revenue obligations. Although we \nbelieve the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable, they are based in part on historical experience, market \nconditions and information obtained from management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.

The estimated fair value of these obligations is determined utilizing a cost build-up approach. The cost \nbuild-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. \nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, \nestimates or actual results.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is \nrecognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nrecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of \nassets and liabilities, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Significant judgment is required in determining our \ncurrent provision for income taxes and deferred tax assets or liabilities. We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax \nassets to an amount for which realization is more likely than not.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account our \ninterpretation and application of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future examinations conducted by \ndomestic and foreign tax authorities. We have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving \ntax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these \nexaminations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and associated reserves. To the extent that the final \ndetermination of any of these examinations is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for \nincome taxes and the effective tax rate in the period in which such determination is made.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nSee Note 1 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recent accounting \npronouncements that are of significance, or potential significance to us. \nACQUISITIONS \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the acquisition of Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a \ncloud-based video collaboration platform, for approximately $1.24 billion and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital \nMedia reportable segment.

If the total unrecognized tax benefits as of December 2, 2022, \nDecember 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020 were recognized, $203 million, $199 million and $136 million would decrease the \nrespective effective tax rates.\nAs of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, the combined amounts of accrued interest and penalties related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million, respectively. These amounts were included \nin long-term income taxes payable in their respective years.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nOur future effective tax rates may be materially affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is \nearned, changes in jurisdictions in which our profits are determined to be earned and taxed, changes in the valuation of our \ndeferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in or interpretation of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do \nbusiness, or unexpected changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits.\nIn addition, the United States and other countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business, including those \ncovered by governing bodies that enact tax laws applicable to us, such as the European Commission of the European Union, \ncould make changes to relevant tax, accounting or other laws and interpretations thereof that have a material impact to us. \nThese countries, governmental bodies and intergovernmental economic organizations such as the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, have or could make unprecedented assertions about how taxation is determined and, in some \ncases, have proposed or enacted new laws that are contrary to the way in which rules and regulations have historically been \ninterpreted and applied.

Other uses of cash include business acquisitions, \npurchases of property and equipment and payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor fiscal 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of $7.84 billion was primarily comprised of net income \nadjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. The primary working capital sources of cash were increases in deferred revenue \ndriven by Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, partially offset by increases in trade receivables attributable to the \ntiming of billings.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFor fiscal 2022, net cash used for investing activities of $570 million was primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures \nand business acquisitions.

See the section titled “Stock Repurchase Program” below.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources Considerations\nOur existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances may fluctuate during fiscal 2023 due to changes in our \nplanned cash outlay. \nCash from operations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, risks \ndetailed in the section titled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this report. Based on our current business plan and revenue \nprospects, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from \noperations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, operating resource expenditure and \ncapital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.\nOur cash equivalent and short-term investment portfolio as of December 2, 2022 consisted of asset-backed securities, \ncorporate debt securities, foreign government securities, money market funds, municipal securities, time deposits, U.S. agency \nTable of Contents\n47\n\n\nsecurities and U.S. Treasury securities. We use professional investment management firms to manage a large portion of our \ninvested cash.\nWe expect to continue our investing activities, including short-term and long-term investments, purchases of computer \nsystems for research and development, sales and marketing, product support and administrative staff, and facilities expansion. \nFurthermore, cash reserves may be used to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to strategically acquire \ncompanies, products or technologies that are complementary to our business.\nOn September 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we intend to acquire Figma, Inc. (“Figma”) \nfor approximately $20 billion, comprised of approximately half cash and half stock, subject to customary purchase price \nadjustments. Approximately 6 million additional restricted stock units will be granted to Figma’s Chief Executive Officer and \nemployees that will vest over four years subsequent to closing. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and customary \nclosing conditions, and is expected to close in 2023. We will be required to pay Figma a reverse termination fee of $1 billion if \nthe transaction fails to receive regulatory clearance, assuming all other closing conditions have been satisfied or waived, or if it \nfails to close within 18 months from September 15, 2022.

Subject to the \nagreement of lenders, we may obtain up to an additional $500 million in commitments, for a maximum aggregate commitment \nof $2 billion. As of December 2, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement and the entire $1.5 \nbillion credit line remains available for borrowing. \nUnder the terms of our Revolving Credit Agreement, we are not prohibited from paying cash dividends unless payment \nwould trigger an event of default or if one currently exists. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable \nfuture.\nSenior Notes\nWe have $4.15 billion senior notes outstanding, which rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated \nindebtedness. As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our senior notes was $4.13 billion and our maximum commitment \nfor interest payments was $416 million for the remaining duration of our outstanding senior notes. Interest is payable semi-\nannually, in arrears on February 1 and August 1. Our senior notes do not contain any financial covenants.

As of December 2, 2022, the carrying value of our current debt was $500 million, net of the \nrelated discount and issuance costs. We intend to repay the current portion of our debt on or before the due date.\nContractual Obligations\nOur purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of \nbusiness. As of December 2, 2022, the value of our non-cancellable unconditional purchase obligations was $6.09 billion, \nprimarily relating to contracts with vendors for third-party hosting and data center services.

In \naddition, the U.S. Tax Act requires companies to capitalize and amortize research and development expenditures starting fiscal \n2023.

We continue to monitor developments and evaluate impacts, if any, of these provisions to our results of operations and \ncash flows.\nStock Repurchase Program\nTo facilitate our stock repurchase program, designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from \nstock issuances, we may repurchase our shares in the open market or enter into structured repurchase agreements with third \nparties. In December 2020, our Board of Directors granted authority to repurchase up to $15 billion in our common stock \nthrough the end of fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares, including approximately 10.4 million shares at an \naverage price of $375.03 through structured repurchase agreements entered into during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, as well as \n5.3 million shares at an average purchase price of $451.55 through an accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into \nduring the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial \ninstitution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1.75 billion. As of December 2, 2022, $583 million of \nprepayment remained under our outstanding structured stock repurchase agreement.\nSubsequent to December 2, 2022, as part of the December 2020 stock repurchase authority, we entered into an \naccelerated share repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of  \n$1.4 billion and received an initial delivery of 3.2 million shares, which represents approximately 75% of our prepayment. \nUpon completion of the $1.4 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement, $5.15 billion remains under our December 2020 \nauthority.\nSee section titled “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity \nSecurities” in Part II, Item 5 of this report for stock repurchases during the quarter ended December 2, 2022 and Note 14 of \nour Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further",

Historically, costs related to these \nindemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these \nindemnification provisions on our future results of operations.\nTo the extent permitted under Delaware law, we have agreements whereby we indemnify our officers and directors for \ncertain events or occurrences while the officer or director is or was serving at our request in such capacity. The indemnification \nperiod covers all pertinent events and occurrences during the officer’s or director’s lifetime.

Additionally, we hedge our net recognized \nforeign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and \ncash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nOur significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n(in millions)\n2022\n2021\n2020\nEuro\n€ \n2,487 € \n2,209 € \n1,887 \nJapanese Yen\n¥ \n118,456 ¥ \n104,829 ¥ \n88,640 \nBritish Pounds\n£ \n737 £ \n669 £ \n562 \nAustralian Dollars\n$ \n876 $ \n768 $ \n645 \nAs of December 2, 2022, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and \nforwards, were $3.25 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $1.32 billion in Euros, $602 million in Indian Rupees, \n$480 million in British Pounds, $394 million in Japanese Yen, $338 million in Australian Dollars and $112 million in other \nforeign currencies.

This sensitivity \nanalysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. \nDollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar \nand a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our \nfinancial hedging instruments by $75 million. A 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would lead to an increase in the \nfair value of these financial instruments by $17 million.\nAs a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in \ncountries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the \nlocal currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization \nand retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 2, 2022 and \nDecember 3, 2021, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $770 million and $749 \nmillion, respectively. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.\nWe do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency \nexposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging \nprogram and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.\nCash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Expenses\nWe may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in \nEuros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars, or foreign currency expenses in Indian Rupees. We hedge these \ncash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. \nThese foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign \nexchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue and expenses in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not \nspeculative in nature.\nWe record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses in \naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs.",

A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a \n$20 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates \nwould lead to a $20 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 2, 2022, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and \ntherefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates.

We have prepared the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules \nand regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP and pursuant to the \nrules and regulations of the SEC, we must make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated \nFinancial Statements and accompanying Notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, sales allowances and programs, bad \ndebts, stock-based compensation, determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, litigation and income \ntaxes. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52- or 53-week year that ends on the Friday closest to November 30. Our financial results for fiscal \n2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal \n2021 was a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2022 and 2020 which were 52-week years.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts, which are not material, have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation in the \nConsolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, \nroyalty, and perpetual software licenses, associated software maintenance and support plans, consulting services, training and \ntechnical support. Most of our enterprise customer arrangements involve multiple promises to our customers.\nRevenue is recognized when a contract exists between us and a customer and upon transfer of control of promised \nproducts or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those \nproducts or services. We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which may be \nTable of Contents\nADOBE INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \n58\n\n\ncapable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations, or in the case of offerings such as cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, accounted for as a single performance obligation.

Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral \ncancellation rights, or options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use committed funds to purchase \nother Adobe products or services.\nFully hosted subscription services (SaaS) allow customers to access hosted software during the contractual term without \ntaking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or \nbased on consumption or usage.\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed \nnumber of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on \nthe date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through \nthe end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in \naccordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable \nconsideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer \nbenefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient. Revenue for subscriptions \nsold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes \nthe benefit of the underlying service.\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-\nenabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is \nrecognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription \nrevenues represent stand-ready performance obligations. Revenue from these subscription support plans is recognized ratably \nover their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or \nbased on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements.

Revenue from on-premise term license or term licensing arrangements with unilateral cancellation rights \nor monthly renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for \ncertain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting \ncontracts on a time-and-materials or fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time-and-\nmaterials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services \nare performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop \nproduct upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the \nterm of the arrangement. Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per \nmonth and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for \nutilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient.\nJudgments\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both \non-premise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services.

In reaching this conclusion, we considered the nature of our \npromise to Creative Cloud and Document Cloud customers, which is to provide a complete end-to-end creative design or \ndocument workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple devices and teams. We fulfill this promise by providing \naccess to a solution that integrates cloud-based and on-premise/on-device features that, together through their integration, \nprovide functionalities, utility and workflow efficiencies that could not be obtained from either the on-premise/on-device \nsoftware or cloud services on their own.\nCloud-based features that are integral to our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings and that work together with \nthe on-premise/on-device s",

Individual products may have multiple values for standalone selling price depending on factors such as where they \nare sold and what channel they are sold through. Where standalone selling price may not be directly observable (e.g., the \nperformance obligation is not sold separately), we maximize the use of observable inputs by using information that may include \nreviewing pricing practices, performance obligations with similar customers and selling models.\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, \nbased on analysis, to be 5 years. We evaluated qualitative and quantitative factors to determine the period of amortization, \nincluding contract length, renewals, customer life and the useful lives of our products and acquired products. When the \nexpected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, \nutilizing the practical expedient. We regularly evaluate whether there have been changes in the underlying assumptions and data \nused to determine the amortization period. \nWhen revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and services, for example in transactions which \ninvolve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, \nand report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis.

This estimate can be affected by the amount of a particular product in the channel, the rate of sell-through, \nproduct plans and other factors.\nAlthough our subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to \ncancel their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term and \nconsumers have a period of time to terminate certain agreements without penalty. In the event a customer cancels their contract, \nthey are generally not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them. Contracts that include termination rights \nwithout substantive penalty are accounted for as contracts only for the committed period. Periods of time after the right of \ntermination are accounted for as optional purchases when they do not represent material rights. For certain of our usage-based \nlicense agreements, typically in our royalty and OEM businesses, reporting may be received after the end of a fiscal period.

In certain of our lease arrangements, \nprimarily those related to our data center arrangements, judgment is required in determining if a contract contains a lease. For \nthese arrangements, there is judgment in evaluating if the arrangement involves an identified asset that is physically distinct or \nwhether we have the right to substantially all of the capacity of an identified asset that is not physically distinct. In \narrangements that involve an identified asset, there is also judgment in evaluating if we have the right to direct the use of that \nasset. \nWe do not have any finance leases. Operating leases are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Right-of-use \n(“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining \nlease payments over the lease term, determined using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. Because the rate \nimplicit in our leases is not readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate, which \napproximates the interest rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments and in \nsimilar economic environments. As of December 2, 2022, our leases had remaining lease terms of up to 9 years, some of which \nincluded options to extend the lease for up to 14 years and options to terminate the lease within 1 year. Optional periods to \nextend the lease, including by not exercising a termination option, are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain \nthat the option will be exercised. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Operating lease expense is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis over the lease term. We account for lease and non-lease components, principally common area maintenance \nfor our facilities leases, as a single lease component for our facilities and data center leases. \nIn accordance with accounting requirements, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are recorded on the balance \nsheet, with lease expense for these leases recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses \nand other current assets for the current portion and other assets for the long-term portion on the Consolidated Balance \nSheets. We regularly review contract asset balances for impairment, considering factors such as historical experience, credit-\nworthiness, age of the balance, current economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast of future economic \nconditions. Contract asset impairments were not material in fiscal 2022 and 2021. Contract assets were $97 million and $85 \nmillion as of December 2, 2022 and December 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Revenue and Remaining Performance Obligations\nDeferred revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from \nsubscription services, including non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds and refundable customer deposits. \nDeferred revenue is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. Customers are typically invoiced \nfor these agreements in regular installments and revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual subscription period. The \ndeferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration, \ninvoice timing, size and new business linearity within the quarter. Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value \nof annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements. \nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within \n30 to 60 days. In instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have determined \nour contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to \nprovide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the \nbeginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our \ncustomers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\nAs of December 2, 2022, the balance of deferred revenue was $5.41 billion, which includes $99 million of refundable \ncustomer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation \nright for which we are obligated to refund amounts paid related to products or services not yet delivered or provided at the time \nof cancellation on a prorated basis.

Significant movements in the deferred \nrevenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying \nperformance obligations to the customer and deferred revenue assumed through acquisition, which were offset by decreases due \nto revenue recognized in the period.

We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that \nare billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based \nroyalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint. \nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $15.19 billion as of December 2, 2022. Non-cancellable and \nnon-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above \ncomprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining \nperformance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the \nnext 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those \ncosts to be longer than one year.

The combined amount of accrued interest and penalties included in long-term income taxes payable related to tax \npositions taken on our tax returns were approximately $17 million and $22 million for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWhile we file federal, state and local income tax returns globally, our major tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and \nthe United States. We are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by various domestic and foreign tax authorities \nwith 2018 being the earliest fiscal year open for examination in all of our major tax jurisdictions. We regularly assess the \nlikelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have \nreserved for potential adjustments that may result from these examinations. We believe our tax estimates to be reasonable; \nhowever, we cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect \non our financial position and results of operations.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax \npayments that are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet \nclassification of our tax assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either \ncertain audits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both. Although \nthe timing of resolution, settlement and closing of audits is not certain, it is reasonably possible that the underlying \nunrecognized tax benefits may decrease by up to $25 million over the next 12 months.\nNOTE 11.

Our performance \nshare awards which are contingent upon achievement of relative total stockholder return are valued using a Monte Carlo \nSimulation model. Our performance share awards which are contingent upon achievement of revenue-based financial metrics \nare valued based on the fair market value of the award on the grant date.\n We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of ESPP purchase rights. The determination \nof the grant date fair value of our ESPP purchase rights is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a \nnumber of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term \nof the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, a risk-free interest rate and any expected \ndividends.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock unit activity for fiscal 2022 was as follows:\nNumber of\nShares\n(in millions)\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date \nFair Value\nAggregate\nFair Value(1)\n(in millions)\nWeighted Average\nRemaining \nContractual Life\n(years)\nBeginning outstanding balance\n \n6.6 $ \n411.52 \nAwarded\n \n4.5 $ \n457.96 \nReleased\n \n(3.0) $ \n381.22 \nForfeited\n \n(0.7) $ \n441.41 \nEnding outstanding balance\n \n7.4 $ \n449.94 $ \n2,511 \n1.33\nExpected to vest\n \n6.7 $ \n449.35 $ \n2,287 \n1.26\n_________________________________________\n(1) \nThe aggregate fair value is calculated using the closing stock price as of December 2, 2022 of $341.53.\nThe weighted average grant date fair values of restricted stock units granted during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were \n$457.96, $504.69 and $358.68, respectively.

Our responsibility is to \nexpress an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over \nfinancial reporting based on our audits.

Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal \ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the \nrisk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the \ncircumstances.

64\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`64`):\n   Answer: Cash flows from operations of $7.84 billion during fiscal 2022 increased by $608 million, or 8%, from $7.23 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher net income after adjustment for non-cash items.\n   Explanation: This figure represents free cash flow for fiscal year 2022. It's a direct extraction from the given document snippet.\n   Citation: Cash flows from operations of $7.84 billion during fiscal 2022 increased by $608 million, or 8%, from $7.23 billion in fiscal 2021 primarily due to higher net income after adjustment for non-cash items.\n\n### Chunk # 65\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 66\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 67\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 68\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 69\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 70\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 71\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`71`):\n   Answer: Net cash used for investing activities was $570 million. Net cash used for financing activities was $6.83 billion. Net cash used for investing and financing activities was $570 million + $6.83 billion = $7.39 billion. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.84 billion. Therefore, free cash flow for FY2022 was $7.84 billion - $7.39 billion = $450 million.\n   Explanation: To calculate free cash flow for FY2022, we need to subtract net cash used for investing and financing activities from net cash provided by operating activities. We can find these numbers from the 'Cash Flows' section of the document.\n   Citation: Cash Flows from Operating Activities\nFor fiscal 2022, net cash provided by operating activities of $7.84 billion was primarily comprised of net income\nadjusted for the net effect of non-cash items. ... \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nFor fiscal 2022, net cash used for investing activities of $570 million was primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures and business acquisitions.\n\n### Chunk # 72\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`72`):\n   Answer: Net cash used for financing activities of $6.83 billion was primarily due to payments for our common stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards.\n   Explanation: I extracted this figure and commentary by focusing on identifying free cash flow numbers and any management discussion related to cash flow for FY2022.\n   Citation: Cash Flows from Financing Activities\nFor fiscal 2022, net cash used for financing activities of $6.83 billion was primarily due to payments for our common stock repurchases and taxes paid related to the net share settlement of equity awards, offset in part by proceeds from re-issuance of treasury stock mainly for our employee stock purchase plan.\n\n### Chunk # 73\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 74\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`74`):\n   Answer: There is no direct mention of free cash flow for FY2022. However, it can be inferred from other cash flow-related information.\n   Explanation: Although free cash flow for FY2022 is not directly stated, we can deduce that there was a significant outflow of cash for stock repurchases. According to the given snippet, $1.75 billion was prepaid for a structured stock repurchase agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Additionally, 15.7 million shares were repurchased at an average price of $451.55. This implies that a substantial amount of cash was used for stock repurchases during fiscal 2022.\n   Citation: During fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 15.7 million shares... During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we entered into a structured stock repurchase agreement with a large financial institution whereupon we provided them with a prepayment of $1.75 billion.\n\n### Chunk # 75\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 76\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 77\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 78\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`78`):\n   Answer: Free cash flow for FY2022 was $6,444 million. This figure can be calculated by subtracting net cash used in investing activities from net cash provided by operating activities.\n   Explanation: Although free cash flow figure for FY2022 is not directly available from the given document, we can infer it by using other related financial data. However, for a more accurate answer, we would need access to other financial statements or reports.\n   Citation: Note that this figure cannot be directly extracted from the given document. However, we can calculate it by using the net cash provided by operating activities and net cash used in investing activities from other financial statements or reports.\n\n### Chunk # 79\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`79`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: Free cash flow numbers for FY2022 cannot be directly extracted from the given financial statements. However, we can calculate free cash flow by subtracting net income from operating cash flow. Since operating cash flow and net income for FY2022 are not available in the given snippet, we cannot calculate free cash flow.\n\n### Chunk # 80\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`80`):\n   Answer: Net cash provided by operating activities for FY2022 was $7,838 million.\n   Explanation: Free cash flow can be calculated as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures. However, capital expenditures (purchases of short-term investments) for FY2022 were $909 million. Therefore, we can approximate free cash flow by subtracting this value from net cash provided by operating activities.\n   Citation: Net cash provided by operating activities:\n$  7,838 \n$  7,230 \n$  5,727\n\n### Chunk # 81\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`81`):\n   Answer: Net cash used for investing activities was ($570) million and net cash used for financing activities was ($6,825) million. Therefore, free cash flow for FY2022 can be calculated as net income plus depreciation and amortization minus net cash used for investing activities minus net cash used for financing activities. However, since we do not have net income or depreciation and amortization for FY2022, we cannot calculate free cash flow directly. But we can calculate it indirectly by looking at net change in cash and cash equivalents.\n   Explanation: Since we do not have net income or depreciation and amortization for FY2022, we cannot calculate free cash flow directly. However, we can calculate it indirectly by looking at net change in cash and cash equivalents. According to the table, net change in cash and cash equivalents for FY2022 was $392 million. This means that free cash flow for FY2022 was $392 million.\n   Citation: Net cash used for investing activities ($570) million and net cash used for financing activities ($6,825) million\n\n### Chunk # 82\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 83\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`83`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No free cash flow numbers were directly extracted from the given document excerpt. However, I focused on identifying any management discussion related to cash flow for FY2022.\n\n### Chunk # 84\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 85\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 86\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 87\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 88\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 89\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 90\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 91\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 92\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`92`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: Free cash flow numbers and related commentary for FY2022 were not directly extracted from the given document. However, I was able to find a table with cash flow from operations and investing activities for each fiscal year.\n   Citation: NOTE 14. CASH FLOW INFORMATION\n... (rest of note omitted for brevity)\n\n### Chunk # 93\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`93`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: Free cash flow figures and related commentary for FY2022 were not found in the given document excerpt.\n\n### Chunk # 94\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 95\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 96\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 97\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 98\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 99\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 100\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 101\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 102\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 103\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`103`):\n   Answer: Not directly available. However, using depreciation and amortization expenses as a proxy for non-cash items, we can estimate free cash flow. Assuming other non-cash items (such as other income (expense), net) were minimal or zero for fiscal 2022, free cash flow would be approximately net income plus depreciation and amortization expenses. However, without net income figure for fiscal 2022, we cannot provide an exact answer.\n   Explanation: Free cash flow was not directly extracted from the given document. However, depreciation and amortization expenses were identified which can be used to estimate free cash flow.\n   Citation: Depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment for fiscal 2022 was $189 million.\n\n### Chunk # 104\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 105\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`105`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: Free cash flow was extracted by looking for cash flow-related terms such as 'cash flow from operations', 'capital expenditures', and 'free cash flow' for fiscal year 2022.\n   Citation: None\n\n### Chunk # 106\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 107\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`107`):\n   Answer: We contributed $76 million to our retirement savings plan in fiscal 2022.\n   Explanation: This figure represents a contribution to our retirement savings plan for fiscal 2022. It's a component of our cash outflow and can be considered as a part of our free cash flow.\n   Citation: In fiscal 2022, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation.

However, this calculation only accounts for operating lease cash flows and may not represent total free cash flow.\n   Explanation: To calculate free cash flow for fiscal year 2022, we need to consider both cash paid for operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets obtained. However, this calculation may not represent total free cash flow as it only accounts for operating lease cash flows.\n   Citation: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $107 $116 $99 Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $59 $60 $52\n\n### Chunk # 119\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 120\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 121\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 122\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 123\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 124\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 125\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 126\n   No relevant data extracted for this chunk.\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\n\nReturn a single JSON object with no triple backticks or extra text.
