Total length: 701520 characters.: \n\n## Question\nHas MGM Resorts paid dividends to common shareholders in FY2022?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 701520 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine whether MGM Resorts paid dividends to common shareholders in FY2022, focus on the sections of the financial document that discuss dividends and shareholder distributions. Key areas to examine include the financial statements, particularly the statement of cash flows and the statement of changes in equity, as these often detail dividend payments. Additionally, review the notes to the financial statements, which may provide specific information about dividend policies and any declared or paid dividends during the fiscal year. The management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section might also offer insights into the company's dividend strategy and any relevant decisions made in FY2022."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

VIP gaming at MGM China is conducted through the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track\nthe amount of wagering conducted to determine VIP gaming play. VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a\nreduction of casino revenue. Main floor players do not receive commissions. We have focused our business on main floor gaming operations and, accordingly,\nVIP gaming operations were not a significant source of revenue in 2022 and we do not expect VIP gaming operations to be a significant source of revenue in\nfuture years. The majority of MGM China's casino revenue has been provided by main floor gaming operations in recent years and we expect this customer\nbase will be the primary source of growth in the future. We offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic\ntable games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use, as well as\nnon-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and MGM Cotai Emerald Villa to attract ultra-high end customers.\nIn December 2021, we suspended operations with our primary gaming promoters indefinitely.

As part of our commitment to the success of BetMGM, we have integrated our MGM Rewards program with BetMGM and have BetMGM\nbranded on-property sportsbooks and kiosks to drive higher value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omni-channel strategy.

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $8.8 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a\nconsolidated basis, including $4.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness of MGM China. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future\nborrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. We do not guarantee MGM\nChina’s obligations under its debt agreements and, to the extent MGM China was to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service its indebtedness, our\nability to make additional investments into MGM China is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility.\nIn addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:\n•\nincreasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n•\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our\nbusiness strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;\n•\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or\n•\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.\nWe currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the $3.01 billion and $3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and\nunpaid thereon) of Bellagio BREIT Venture and VICI BREIT Venture, respectively. The terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted\ncertain remedies to collect on the obligations under\n14\n\n\nthe underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation, which amount may be\nmaterial, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future.

If MGM Grand\nParadise is unable to satisfy its investment commitments, its concession contract may be subject to termination by the Macau government. See “—Risks\nRelated to Our Macau Operations—The Macau government can (i) terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s concession under certain circumstances without\ncompensating MGM Grand Paradise, (ii) from the eighth year of MGM Grand Paradise’s concession, redeem the concession by providing MGM Grand\nParadise at least one year’s prior notice and subject to the payment of reasonable and fair damages or indemnity to MGM Grand Paradise, or (iii) refuse to\ngrant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the concession in 2032.”\nMoreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically\ninvest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. The leases for our operating properties have fixed rental\npayments (with annual escalators) and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those\nproperties. Such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds\nmust be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in Japan, strategic\ninitiatives, including positioning BetMGM as a leader in online sports betting and iGaming, investments in the growth of our international digital gaming\nbusiness, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of\ncontingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and\nsignificant financial commitments or make planned expenditures.

The hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming industries are highly competitive. We do\nnot believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming operations in other states or countries, as\nwell as the increased availability of online sports betting and iGaming, could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel\nroom capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also\nexpand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the\ndomestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of retail gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has\nincreased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. For instance, local referendums were recently passed to allow retail gaming in\nVirginia and Nebraska, with active lobbying occurring in additional states. While we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts\nwith well-established and recognized brands, we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peer inventory sources, which allow travelers to book\nshort-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners. We expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution,\ninnovations in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain\ncustomers and related business.\nWe have also seen significant expansion across the United States in legalized forms of iGaming and online sports betting and expect additional\njurisdictions will likely legalize iGaming and online sports betting in the future. We participate in the domestic iGaming and online sports betting market\nthrough our venture, BetMGM, which faces significant competition from other industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment\nindustries. If BetMGM is unable to sustain or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able to gain the scale necessary to successfully compete in the growing\nmarket and, as a result, we may not receive the anticipated benefits from our investment.

For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located\nelsewhere in or near Asia, certain areas in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) may legalize\ncasino gaming (or iGaming) in the future. Furthermore, currently MGM Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau\ngovernment to operate casinos in Macau. If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional\nconcessions or if current concessionaires open additional facilities, we would face increased competition. Similarly, as a result of Macau’s Gaming Inspection\nand Co-ordination Bureau increasing scrutiny and restrictions imposed on gaming promoters, we along with certain other casino operators in Macau, suspended\nour primary gaming promoters, which has led to substantial declines in revenues from gaming promoters.

If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of\ncustomers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a travel destination, as well as the results of operations at our developments in Macau, could be\nnegatively impacted.\nWe have suspended our payment of ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders, and may not elect to resume paying dividends in the foreseeable\nfuture or at all. On February 8, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors had determined to suspend our ongoing regular dividends in order to focus on\nour preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. Our future resumption of dividend payments, if any, would be\nsubject to the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, and our ability to pay any dividends in the future could be limited by a variety of factors, including our\nholding company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries, state law requirements, our future liquidity position,\npotential alternative uses of cash, general economic conditions and expected future financial results, in addition to other factors, some of which may be beyond\nour control. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will resume paying dividends in the foreseeable future or at all, which could adversely affect the\nmarket price of our common stock.\nAll of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease\ntermination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position\nor results of operations.

Given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business\nmay be significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any\nevents that disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las\nVegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices, lower demand,\nor otherwise, can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between Las Vegas and Southern\nCalifornia, where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of\ncustomers who visit our facilities.\nWe extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables. We conduct a portion of our gaming\nactivities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers than slot\nplayers, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other\nforms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and\nearnings in a particular quarter.

Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors\nmay be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nFurthermore, we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the\nextent MGM China gaming customers are from other jurisdictions, MGM China may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its\ngaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM China may encounter forums that will\nrefuse to enforce such debts.

In addition to acquiring or\ndeveloping hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to\ninvest, in properties or businesses as a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business.

Furthermore, the occurrence of risks that adversely affect the businesses of our joint ventures or other unconsolidated affiliates could reduce the value\nof our investments in such entities, impair their ability to make any potential future distributions to us or require that we make additional capital contributions\nto them. The shared nature of control over such ventures may limit our ability to directly manage these risks.\nIn addition, investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the\nfinancial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a\nposition to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject the\nproperties or businesses owned by such entities to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors, or our co-\ninvestors could take actions binding on the property without our consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its\nshare of liabilities.\nFor example, we share control of BetMGM with Entain with all major operating, investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both\nmembers.

Water is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems in which we\noperate. Water is also a limited resource in many parts of the world, including Las Vegas where the majority of our properties are located. Water availability is\nfacing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, the effects of climate change, and increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial\nproducts whose manufacturing processes require water. As the demand for water continues to increase in the areas in which we operate, and as water becomes\nscarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, our operations may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the possibility of reputational\ndamage, which could adversely affect our profitability.\n23\n\n\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations. Our ownership and operation of gaming operations is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces\nin which we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability\nand character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming\nregulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in\nthat jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction\ncould have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in\nthe future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, our iGaming and online sports betting initiatives\nmay be particularly subject to risks related to potential changes in the regulatory and enforcement environment as a result of the continued development of\nregulatory schemes in this industry in the U.S. and internationally. For a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see “Regulation and\nLicensing” and Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFurther, our directors, officers, key employees and investors in our properties and iGaming and online sports betting initiatives must meet approval\nstandards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities. If such regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be\nrequired to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to di",

Certain\npublic and private issuances of securities, borrowings under credit agreements, guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of\ncertain regulatory authorities.\nMacau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future\nrender an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, MGM Grand Paradise's activities in Macau are subject to\nadministrative review and approval by various government agencies. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to obtain all necessary\napprovals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to the courts with\nrespect to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.\nIn addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general.\nThese laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking,\nemployees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. For instance, we are subject to certain federal, state and\nlocal environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Energy Policy Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Renewable Portfolio\nStandards, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and many others. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of\nreal property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of\nwhether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change\nor could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, smoking in casinos in\nMacau, including MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, is only permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or VIP areas.\nThe likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, t",

We\nare also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve funds from\nillegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose. In addition, under the Bank\nSecrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act\nis subject to periodic examinations by the IRS.

Our properties in Macau were open during the first half of 2022, however, gaming operations were\ntemporarily suspended on July 11, 2022 due to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in Macau and resumed on July 23, 2022, subject to certain\ncontinuing health safeguards. On October 30, 2022, a COVID-19 case was identified as connected to MGM Cotai. All guests and staff were isolated until\nNovember 1, 2022 and all gaming, hotel, restaurant, and retail operations were suspended with limited operations expected to resume beginning November 3,\n2022. More broadly, electronic applications for individual and group travel visas to Macau resumed on November 1, 2022, however, certain travel and entry\nrestrictions in Macau and mainland China remained in place at the time, including COVID-19 testing and certain quarantine requirements, which significantly\n25\n\n\nimpacted visitation to our Macau properties. Beginning in December 2022, Macau and mainland China started unwinding testing and quarantine requirements\nas well as travel and entry restrictions associated with the “dynamic zero” COVID-19 policy. On January 8, 2023, Macau lifted the majority of its COVID-19\npandemic travel and quarantine restrictions with the exception of overseas visitors travelling from outside of mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan being\nrequired to present a negative nucleic acid test or rapid antigen test result in place until February 6, 2023 when all remaining COVID-19 travel restrictions were\nremoved. Although COVID-19 measures have not been reimplemented to date, the extent and timing of further closures of MGM China’s properties,\nlimitations of operations, or whether further travel restrictions to or from Macau will be reimplemented is uncertain if there is an increase or continued spread\nof COVID-19.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and new variants continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial results, including\nthe duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess.

Most of our\nrevenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts\nto generate operating cash flow to pay rent, fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, repay debt financings, and return\ncapital to our shareholders. We lease the real estate assets of our domestic resorts pursuant to triple-net lease agreements and make significant investments in\nour resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We also offer\nonline gaming and sports betting through LeoVegas, our consolidated subsidiary, as well as through BetMGM, our unconsolidated affiliate.\nOur results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we\ncontinue to be focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet with adequate liquidity and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing\non strategic development or ",

While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant\nportion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing\nto customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from\na specific country or region can affect our results. Our results will also depend upon our ability to expand our ownership, management and operation of gaming\nfacilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe spread of COVID-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results\nof operations and cash flows in 2020, 2021 and 2022 and may continue to impact our business thereafter.

Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, our\ndomestic jurisdictions eased and removed prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2022, all of our domestic properties were open and not subject to operating restrictions; however, travel and business volume were negatively\naffected in the early part of the first quarter of 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant.\nIn Macau, following a temporary closure of our properties on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain health\nsafeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and\nbars, temperature checks, and mask protection.

MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers.\nWe maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely.\nThese collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements\nand delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in\nthe United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may\nbe reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue\ncredit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates credit\nworthiness prior to issuing credit.\nWe maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. Expected credit losses, an operating expense, increases the loss\nreserve. We regularly evaluate the loss reserve for casino accounts, which involves judgments and assumptions about realizability, current and expected future\neconomic conditions in various geographies, and business conditions. At domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the loss reserve is generally\nestablished by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which is supported by ongoing evaluation of relevant historical analysis and\nany other known information such as the current economic conditions that could drive losses. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply\nstandard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance\nover the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s current and expected future financial condition, collection history, and current\nand expected future economic conditions. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account\nthe age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the customer. Approximately $54 million and $63 million of casino receivables and\n$25 million and $31 million of the loss reserve for casino receivables relate to MGM China at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2022\n2021\n \n(In thousands)\nCasino receivables\n$\n500,986\n$\n380,907\nLoss reserve for casino accounts receivable\n97,929\n117,539\nLoss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivab",

Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the loss reserve and credit losses can change significantly between periods, as\ninformation about a certain customer becomes\n47\n\n\nknown or as changes in economic conditions occur. At December 31, 2022, a 100 basis-point change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino receivables\nwould change income before income taxes by $5 million.\nFixed Asset Capitalization\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was\ntherefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably\nprolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and\ncontractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense, or a\ncapital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise\nimpaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’\nestimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage\nof the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used.\nSeveral criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the\nasset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of\ncarrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For\nassets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset,\non an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset.

For operating assets, fair value is\ntypically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a\nstandard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining\nconstruction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.\nThere are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of\nthe asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the\nlowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of\nassets. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.\nOn a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential\nimpairment. Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative\nindustry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows\nusing our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the\nasset group, including potential sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a\nsubstantial margin.\nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment\ntest for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and\ntrademarks. For our 2022 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative (“step zero”) analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived\nintangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. As\ndiscussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If certain future operating results do not meet current\nexpectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge.\nWe review goodwill at least annually and between annu",

The gaming subconcession was an entity-\nwide asset of MGM China as the benefit of the right to conduct gaming provided by the gaming subconcession was shared by each of MGM China’s casino\nresorts and the cash flows generated by the gaming subconcession cannot be separated from the casino resorts in which gaming operations are conducted. We\ndetermined that the real estate is the primary asset of the asset group as the real estate component generates a significant portion of the entity’s cash flows\nthrough gaming operations conducted at its casino resorts. Accordingly, cash flows were projected over the remaining useful life of the real estate, including\ncash flows from gaming operations. The estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group significantly exceeded the carrying value; accordingly, no\nimpairment was indicated.\nThere were several estimates inherent in evaluating the gaming subconcession asset for impairment. The determination of the asset group to be tested for\nrecoverability and the primary asset of the asset group are matters of judgment as it is dependent on corporate structure, the legal and regulatory environment in\nwhich the entity operates, and the level of interdependency between assets used in revenue generating activities. The determination of the primary asset directly\naffects the period over which cash flows are forecasted when performing the recoverability test. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature,\nsubjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of undiscounted cash flows used in the impairment tests\nare highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of land concession renewals and successfully obtaining a gaming concession in connection\nwith future public tenders.\nAdditionally, we reassessed the useful life of the gaming subconcession intangible asset and, given the new gaming law and the resulting changes\ndescribed above, we determined that the useful life would no longer be based on the initial term of the MGM Cotai land concession that ends in January 2038,\nand that the new useful life is consistent with the remaining contractual term of the existing gaming subconcession, which ended on December 31, 2022.\nAccordingly, amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was recognized on a straight-line basis over its reduced useful life, thereby\naccelerating the recognition of amortization within our statements of operations.\nThe determination of the unit of account and useful life of the gaming subconcession are based upon facts and ci",

During 2022, our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments. In 2021 and 2020, we recorded $22 million\nand $64 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairment charges on equity method investments. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes\npaid in foreign jurisdictions are not material.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences with future tax\nconsequences. We reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.\nAccordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such \"more-likely-than-not\"\nrealization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future\nprofitability, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies.\nWe recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our domestic jurisdictions of $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2022\nand 2021, respectively, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of foreign jurisdictions of $245 million and $149 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period. In the event we were to determine that it is\nmore likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and\nrecognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later\ndetermine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation\nallowance.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket Risk\nIn addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss\narising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is\ninterest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term\nfixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future\nearnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment,\nfuture earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt\nmatures. We do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 17% of our total borrowings.

The Company recognized 100% of the\nacquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The estimated fair values of the identified intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the\nincome approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The intangible assets include $130 million of trademarks, which is an indefinite-lived\nintangible asset, and $95 million of customer lists, which is amortized over its estimated useful life of seven years. Goodwill of $1.3 billion was recognized as\nthe excess of the cash consideration over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe fair value determination of the trademarks and customer lists required management to make significant estimates and assumptions around expected\ncash flows and projected financial results, including forecasted revenues and\n54\n\n\nexpenses (collectively the “forecast”), as well as the selection of discount rates.

On June 23, 2022, MGM Grand Paradise entered into an addendum to its\nsubconcession pursuant to which its gaming subconcession was extended to December 31, 2022. Further, a new gaming law was approved by the Macau\nLegislative Assembly on June 21, 2022. Under the new gaming law, the existing subconcessions were discontinued and a maximum of six concessions were to\nbe awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain\nexceptional circumstances.\nThe enactment of the new Macau gaming law in June 2022 provides for material changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including\ndiscontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their expiration, and also includes material changes to the rights and obligations provided\nfor under the new gaming concessions.

With the assistance of technical accounting specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of management’s application of the accounting\nguidance in ASC 350-30 and the judgments used by management to determine the unit of account and the revision of the useful life of the MGM\nGrand Paradise gaming subconcession intangible asset.\n•\nWe recalculated the accelerated amortization expense from June 21, 2022 through December 31, 2022 based on the revision of the useful life.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nFebruary 24, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n56\n\n\nMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share data)\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2022\n2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n5,911,893 \n$\n4,703,059 \nRestricted cash\n— \n500,000 \nAccounts receivable, net\n852,149 \n583,915 \nInventories\n126,065 \n96,374 \nIncome tax receivable\n73,016 \n273,862 \nPrepaid expenses and other\n583,132 \n258,972 \nAssets held for sale\n608,437 \n— \nTotal current assets\n8,154,692 \n6,416,182 \n \nProperty and equipment, net\n5,223,928 \n14,435,493 \n \nOther assets\nInvestments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates\n173,039 \n967,044 \nGoodwill\n5,029,312 \n3,480,997 \nOther intangible assets, net\n1,551,252 \n3,616,385 \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net\n24,530,929 \n11,492,805 \nOther long-term assets, net\n1,029,054 \n490,210 \nTotal other assets\n32,313,586 \n20,047,441 \n \n$\n45,692,206 \n$\n40,899,116 \nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\n \n \nAccounts a",

(formerly Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.), a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of\nchance and other casino games for a period commencing on April 20, 2005 through March 31, 2020. Pursuant to the then-existing Macau gaming law, upon\nreaching the maximum duration foreseen in the law (up to a maximum term of 20 years), the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by\norder of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. In 2019, MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession term was extended from March\n31, 2020 to June 26, 2022, consistent with the expiration of the other concessionaires and subconcessionaires. On June 23, 2022, MGM Grand Paradise entered\ninto an addendum to its subconcession pursuant to which its gaming subconcession was extended to December 31, 2022 (refer to Note 7 for additional\nconsiderations relating to the gaming subconcession). In connection with the extension, MGM Grand Paradise paid the Macau government MOP 47 million\n(approximately $6 million).\nOn January 14, 2022, the Macau government disclosed the content of a proposed bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public\nconsultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. The new gaming law was approved by the Macau Legislative\nAssembly on June 21, 2022 and published in the Macau Official Gazette on June 22, 2022. Under the new gaming law, the existing subconcessions were\ndiscontinued and a maximum of six concessions were to be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and\nwhich may be extended by three years under certain exceptional circumstances. The enactment of the new gaming law preceded the public tender for the\nawarding of new gaming concessions for which the rules of the public tender\n63\n\n\nwere published on July 1, 2022, which outlined the details for the bidding, the qualifications of bidding companies, and the criteria for granting the new gaming\nconcessions.

Upon re-opening, the properties continued to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, with restrictions varying\nby jurisdiction. Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, the Company’s domestic jurisdictions\neased and removed prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies. As of December 31, 2022, all of\nthe Company’s domestic properties were open and not subject to operating restrictions; however, travel and business volume were negatively affected in the\nearly part of the first quarter of 2022 due to the spread of the omicron variant.\nIn Macau, following a temporary closure of the Company’s properties on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain\nhealth safeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants\nand bars, temperature checks, and mask protection.

The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is\nthe primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary\nbeneficiary. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that\naffect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary\nbeneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.\n64\n\n\nThe venture (the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”) that is 5% owned by a subsidiary of the Company and 95% owned by a subsidiary of BREIT is a VIE\nbecause the equity holders as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such\nentity’s economic performance. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of Bellagio BREIT Venture because the Company does not have power to direct\nthe activities that could potentially be significant to the venture as BREIT, as the managing member, has such power; accordingly, the Company does not\nconsolidate the venture. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss in Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment of $56 million\nas of December 31, 2022, assuming no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the Company’s guarantee of the debt of\nBellagio BREIT Venture, which guarantee is immaterial as of December 31, 2022, as further discussed in Note 12.\nFor entities determined not t",

For entities in which\nthe Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial\ninterest based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling\ninterest in the consolidated balance sheets and all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If the entity does not qualify for\nconsolidation under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company\ngenerally accounts for the entity under the equity method, such as BetMGM, which does not qualify for consolidation as the Company has joint control, given\nthe entity is structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate in the decision making process, which prevents the Company from\nexerting a controlling financial interest in such entity, as defined in ASC 810. For entities over which the Company does not have significant influence, such as\nVICI OP, the Company accounts for its equity investment under ASC 321.\nReclassifications. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period presentation.\nManagement’s use of estimates. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments\nin unconsolidated affiliates or equity interests, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value\nmeasurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to\nsell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a\nhierarchy that includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are quoted prices for identical or comparable\ninstruments or pricing using observable market data; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value\nmeasurements:\n•\nLevel 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments recorded at fair value;\n•\nL",

See Note 4.\nEquity investments. Fair value is measured based upon trading prices on the applicable securities exchange for equity investments for which the\nCompany has elected the fair value option of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 825, such as LeoVegas (prior to consolidation), and equity\ninvestments accounted for under ASC 321 that have a readily determinable fair value, such as VICI OP. The fair value of these investments was $461 million\nand $66 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is reflected within “Other long-term assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets.\nGains and losses are recorded in “Other, net” in the statements of operations. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021 the Company recorded a net\ngain on its equity investments of $10 million and $28 million, respectively.\nDebt investments. The Company’s investments in debt securities are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value. Gains and losses are\nrecorded in “Other, net” in the statement of operations. Debt securities are considered cash equivalents if the criteria for such classification is met or otherwise\nclassified as short-term investments within “Prepaid expenses and other” since the investment of cash is available for current operations.\nThe following tables present information regarding the Company’s debt investments:\n65\n\n\nFair value level\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In thousands)\nCash and cash equivalents:\nMoney market funds\nLevel 1\n$\n12,009 \nCommercial paper and certificates of deposit\nLevel 2\n5,992 \nCash and cash equivalents\n18,001 \nShort-term investments:\nU.S. government securities\nLevel 1\n56,835 \nU.S. agency securities\nLevel 2\n9,530 \nCommercial paper and certificates of deposit\nLevel 2\n4,466 \nCorporate bonds\nLevel 2\n213,875 \nShort-term investments\n284,706 \nTotal debt investments\n$\n302,707 \nCash and cash equivalents.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of\ncasino receivables. The Company issues credit following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. At December  31, 2022 and 2021,\napproximately 52% and 53%, respectively, of the Company’s gross accounts receivable related to casino receivables.\nAccounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account\nto be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated loss reserve is maintained to reduce the Company’s\nreceivables to their net carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The loss reserve is estimated based on both a specific review of customer accounts as\nwell as historical collection experience and current and expected future economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2022,\nno significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which a loss reserve had not already been recorded.\nInventories. Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or net\nrealizable value. Cost is determined primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is\ndetermined using the cost method.\nProperty and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired\nthrough business combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are\nincluded in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n66\n\n\nProperty and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:\nBuildings and improvements\n15 to 40 years\nLand improvements\n10 to 20 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n3 to 20 years\nEquipment\n3 to 15 years\nThe Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held\nand used.

If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying\nvalue, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair\nvalue of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining\nconstruction costs.

The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project.\nWhen no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of the\nCompany’s outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more\nthan a brief period.\nInvestments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates. The Company has investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity\nmethod.

If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated\nfair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is “other-than-temporary”\nbased on its assessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair\nvalue using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a\nmarket approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business\ncombinations. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of trademarks and certain of our gaming licenses. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be\nreviewed for impairment at least annually and between\n67\n\n\nannual test dates in certain circumstances.

No material impairments\nwere indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nAccounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly\nreferred to as “step zero”) in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. In performing the step zero analysis the Company considers\nmacroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the\ncomposition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units for goodwill. In addition, the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair\nvalue over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the period of time that has passed since the last quantitative\nanalysis.

When available, such as for the Company’s triple-net operating leases for which the lessor\nhas provided its implicit rate or provided the assumptions required for the Company to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, the Company uses the\nrate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Company’s leases, such as its ground subleases and equipment\nleases, the Company cannot readily determine the implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments\nfor such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is\nreasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Company’s triple-net operating leases each contain renewal periods at the Company’s option, each of\nwhich are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised.

As described in Note 1, the enactment of the new Macau gaming law in June 2022 provided for\nmaterial changes to the legal form of gaming concessions in Macau, including discontinuing and prohibiting gaming subconcessions subsequent to their\nexpiration, and also included material changes to the rights and obligations provided for under the new gaming concessions. As a result, the Company\ndetermined that the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession and new gaming concession are two separate units of account.\nFurther, as the material changes in the legal and regulatory environment could have an adverse effect on the value of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming\nsubconcession, the Company concluded that a triggering event had occurred under ASC 360 in June 2022 for the MGM China asset group. The Company\ncompared the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to its carrying value and determined that the undiscounted cash flows significantly\nexceeded the carrying value and, therefore, no impairment was indicated.\nAdditionally, in June 2022, the Company reassessed the useful life of the gaming subconcession intangible asset and determined that, given the new\ngaming law and the resulting changes described above, the useful life would no longer be based on the initial term of the MGM Cotai land concession, which\nends in January 2038, and that the useful life should be revised to align with the cessation of the subconcession rights that occurred at the end of the contractual\nterm of the gaming subconcession, which ended on December 31, 2022. Accordingly, amortization of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over its reduced useful life. The gaming subconcession was fully amortized as of December 31, 2022.\nAmortization expense related to intangible assets was $2.7 billion, $197 million and $194 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

The FTCs are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross\ngaming revenue in Macau. Because MGM Grand Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company\nbelieves payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. While the Company\ngenerally does not expect to generate new FTC carryovers after the year ended December 31, 2017, it will be able to utilize its existing FTC carryovers to the\nextent it has active foreign source income during the 10-year FTC carryforward period. Such foreign source income includes the recapture, to the extent of a\nportion of U.S. taxable income each year, of overall domestic losses that totaled approximately $356 million at December 31, 2022. The Company relies on\nfuture U.S. source operating income in assessing utilization of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTC realization during the 10-year FTC\ncarryover period. The FTC carryovers will expire if not utilized as follows: $976 million in 2023; $780 million in 2024; $674 million in 2025; $134 million in\n2026; and $200 million in 2027.\nThe Company’s assessment of the realization of its FTC deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S.\noperating profits and foreign source income.

Absent the exemption from complementary tax on gaming\nprofits, “Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have increased by $3 million in 2022 and decreased by $10 million in 2021 and diluted\nearnings per share would have increased by $0.01 in 2022 and decreased by $0.02 in 2021.

The valuation allowance on Macau deferred tax assets increased by $89 million during 2022 as a result of accelerating amortization for the remaining\nuseful life of the MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession.\nThe Company has NOLs in some of the states in which it operates that total $373 million as of December 31, 2022, which equates to deferred tax assets\nof $23 million after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance.

Restrictive Covenants. Employee acknowledges that in the course of performing Employee’s responsibilities under this\nAgreement Employee will form relationships and become acquainted with Employer and Company’s “Trade Secrets” and\n“Confidential Information” (defined below in Sections 8.3.1 and 8.3.2). Employee further acknowledges that such relationships,\nTrade Secrets, and Confidential Information are valuable to Employer. Employee therefore acknowledges that the restrictions on\nEmployee’s future employment contained in this Agreement, if any, are reasonably necessary and appropriate in scope such that\nsuch restrictions do not impose an undue hardship on Employee and are no broader than necessary for the protection of Employer.\nIn light of the valuable consideration provided for in this Agreement including, but not limited to, Employee’s offer of employment\nand/or continued employment, and the “Severance Payment” to which Employee is entitled to under the circumstances stated below\nin Section 10, Employee agrees as follows:\n8.1 Competition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) during the\nSpecified Term, (i) Employer terminates this Agreement due to elimination of Employees position (and such general duties are\nnot otherwise moved to another position or role regardless of the title) or (ii) Employee terminates this Agreement with\nEmployee Good Cause, or (b) Employee remains employed at-will by Employer after expiration of the Specified Term and is\nthereafter separated by Employer during the Restricted Period for any reason other than “Employer’s Good Cause” (defined\nbelow), Employee shall not be subject to this Section 8.1.\n8.1.1. Competitor Defined. “Competitor” means any person, corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other\nentity which is either directly, indirectly or through an affiliated company, engaged in or proposes to engage in the\ndevelopment, ownership, operation or management of (i) gaming facilities; (ii) convention or meeting facilities; or (iii) one\nor more hotels if any such hotel is connected in any way, whether physically or by business association, to a gaming\nestablishment and, further, where Competitor’s activities are within a 150 mile radius of any location where any of the\nforegoing facilities, hotels, or venues are, or are proposed to be, owned, operated, managed or developed by the Company.\nGiven the unique nature of Employee’s involvement in Employer’s sports betting and mobile gaming/betting business,\nCompetitor also includes any business or enterprise (located anywhere in the world) which owns, operates, develops,\nmaintains or facilitates the\n5\n\n\noperation of mobile gaming/betting, regardless of whether such mobile gaming/betting is conducted online, through an\n“app,” via peer-to-peer transactions, and/or under the auspices of a gaming-resort. Without limitation, William Hill is an\nexample of such a Competitor, and Flutter Entertainment plc (formerly Paddy Power Betfair plc), which is based in Ireland,\nthe United Kingdom and Italy, but which engages in business in the United States, is another. Because Employer’s business\ninterest in the mobile gaming/betting market and customer base is not dependent on geographic proximity or location and\ninstead draws from Business Contacts around the world, and because such business or enterprise allows for Employee to\nwork remotely, Employee agrees the foregoing world- wide restriction is reasonable and necessary.\n8.2 Non-Solicitation.

Gaming regulators have broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable or\nqualified. Subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict,\nrevoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability, qualification or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or\napproved, for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming regulator. The criteria used in determining whether to grant or renew a license or finding of\nsuitability or qualification vary from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction but generally include such factors as:\n•\nthe good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant;\n•\nthe financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, including whether the gaming operation in the jurisdiction is adequately\ncapitalized to pay winning wagers as and when due, meet ongoing operating expenses, pay all local, state and federal taxes as and when due,\nmake necessary capital and maintenance expenditures in a timely manner, and make all long-term and short-term debt payments and satisfy\ncapital lease obligations as and when due;\n•\nthe quality of the applicant’s gaming facility and non-gaming amenities;\n•\nthe total amount of the investment in the applicant’s gaming facility and non-gaming amenities;\n•\nthe effect on competition and the general impact on the host and surrounding communities;\n•\nthe amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable jurisdiction through the operation of the applicant’s gaming facility; and\n•\nthe applicant’s practices with respect to minority and local hiring and training of its workforce.\nIn evaluating individual applicants, gaming regulators consider, among other things, the individual’s good character, honesty and integrity, financial\n",

For example, in Maryland, state law allows us to hold an interest in only one video lottery operation. Licenses\nunder gaming laws are generally not transferable, although some jurisdictions permit a transfer with the prior approval of the jurisdiction’s gaming regulator(s).\nLicenses in many of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming operations are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. There\ncan be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed.\nA gaming license is generally a revocable privilege. Many jurisdictions have statutory or regulatory provisions that govern the required action that may\nbe taken in the event that a license is revoked or not renewed. For example, under New Jersey gaming laws, a conservator may be appointed by the New Jersey\nCasino Control Commission (“NJCCC”) to assume complete operational control of the casino and the approved hotel facility upon the revocation of a casino\nlicense, and the conservator may, at the direction of the NJCCC and after appropriate prior consultation with the former licensee as to the reasonableness of\nsuch terms and conditions, endeavor to and be authorized to sell, assign, convey or otherwise dispose of in bulk, subject to any and all valid liens, claims, and\nencumbrances, all the property of a former licensee relating to the casino and the approved hotel.\nIn addition to us and our direct and indirect subsidiaries engaged in gaming operations, gaming regulators may investigate any individual or entity having\na material relationship to, or material involvement with, any of these entities to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a\nbusiness associate of a gaming licensee. Certain jurisdictions require that any change in our directors or officers, including the directors or officers of our\nsubsidiaries, must be approved by the requisite gaming regulator(s). Our officers, directors and certain key employees must also file applications with gaming\nregulators and may be required to be licensed or be found suitable or qualified in many jurisdictions. Gaming regulators have broad discretion to deny an\napplication for licensing. Qualification and suitability determinations require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough\nbackground investigation. The applicant has the burden of demonstrating suitability or qualification for licensure, and the applicant ordinarily must pay all the\ncosts of the investigation.

In addition, gaming regulators may require us to terminate the\nemployment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.\n2\n\n\nIn many jurisdictions, any of our shareholders or holders of our debt securities may be required to file an application, be investigated, and qualify or have\nhis, her or its suitability determined. For example, under Nevada gaming laws, any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares\nowned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her suitability as a beneficial holder of the voting securities determined if either\nthe Nevada Gaming Commission (the “NGC”) has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State\nof Nevada, or the person engages in certain statutorily proscribed activities which influence or affect the affairs of a holding company of a Nevada gaming\nlicensee. The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the NGC and the Nevada Gaming Control Board (“NGCB”) in conducting any such\ninvestigation.\nFurthermore, any person required by a gaming regulator to be found suitable, who is found unsuitable by the gaming regulator, shall not be able to hold\ndirectly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any voting security or the beneficial or record ownership of any nonvoting security or any debt security of any\npublic corporation which is registered with the gaming regulator (or otherwise subject to a finding of suitability or qualification as holding company of a\ngaming licensee), such as MGM Resorts International, beyond the time prescribed by the gaming regulator. A finding of unsuitability by a particular gaming\nregulator impacts that person’s ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in that particular jurisdiction and could impact the person’s ability to\nassociate or affiliate with gaming licensees in other jurisdictions.\nMany jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of our voting securities and, in some\njurisdictions, our non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming regulators, and gaming regulators may require such holders to apply\nfor qualification or a finding of suitability. For example, Nevada gaming laws require any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of our voting\nsecurities to report the acquisition to the NGC.

The average gross revenue is calculated according to the maximum\nnumber of gaming tables and electric or mechanical gaming machines, including slot machines, authorized for the concessionaire in the year to which it relates,\nwith the exception of the number of gaming tables and electric or mechanical gaming machines, including slot machines authorized to operate temporarily.\nMGM Grand Paradise Limited is also subject to the following additional levies: annual payment in an amount corresponding to 2% of gross gaming\nrevenue which will be given to a public foundation whose object is the promotion, development or study of cultural, social, economic, educational, scientific,\nacademic, and charity activities; and annual payment in an amount corresponding to 3% of gross gaming revenue which will be used for urban development\nand construction, promotion of tourism and social security. The Macau Government may grant a reduction or exemption from the payment of the additional\nlevies for reasons of public interest, namely for expansion of overseas customer markets, pursuant to terms to be defined under supplementary regulations.\nCurrently, the gaming tax in Macau is calculated as a percentage of gross gaming revenue. However, gross gaming revenue does not include deductions\nfor credit losses. As a result, if MGM Grand Paradise issues markers to its customers in Macau and is unable to collect on the related receivables from them, it\nhas to pay taxes on its winnings from these customers even though it was unable to collect the related re",

      "output": "We have gathered three pieces of information from the junior models regarding dividends paid by MGM Resorts to common shareholders in FY2022:\n\n1. One output states that MGM Resorts suspended their payment of ongoing regular dividends in FY2022 and may not resume them in the foreseeable future. This suggests no dividends were paid.\n\n2. Another output indicates that dividends paid to common shareholders amounted to $77 in FY2022, extracted from the 'Cash flows from financing activities' section.\n\n3. A third output mentions that dividends declared and paid were $0.01 per share in FY2022.\n\nTo determine if the information is sufficient, we need to consider the consistency and reliability of these outputs. There is a conflict between the first output, which suggests no dividends were paid, and the other two outputs, which indicate some level of dividend payment.\n\nThe second and third outputs provide specific figures and are extracted from financial statement sections, which typically offer reliable data. The second output's citation from the 'Cash flows from financing activities' section is particularly compelling, as this section is a standard place to report actual cash outflows for dividends.\n\nGiven the conflicting information, the second output, which provides a specific amount and a credible citation, seems more reliable. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that MGM Resorts did pay dividends to common shareholders in FY2022, amounting to $77, despite the suspension of regular dividends. This suggests that while regular dividends were suspended, some form of dividend payment still occurred."
