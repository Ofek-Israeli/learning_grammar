Total length: 20586 characters.: \n\n## Question\nWhat percent of Ulta Beauty's total spend on stock repurchases for FY 2023 occurred in Q4 of FY2023?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 20586 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Ulta Beauty's stock repurchases, focus on identifying the total amount spent on stock repurchases for the entire fiscal year 2023 and the specific amount spent during the fourth quarter of that year. Look for sections in the financial document that detail quarterly financial activities, particularly those related to stock buybacks or share repurchase programs. Pay attention to any tables or summaries that break down financial activities by quarter, as these will likely provide the necessary figures. Once you have both the total annual and Q4-specific repurchase amounts, you can calculate the percentage of the total annual spend that occurred in Q4."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

It assigns two tasks to each chunk: one to extract the total annual stock repurchase amount and another to extract the Q4-specific amount. Each task is atomic and focuses on a specific piece of information.\n\n- **transform_outputs**: This function filters and aggregates the outputs from the small language models. It filters out jobs with empty or null answers and organizes the results by task and chunk. The aggregated string includes all relevant information from the outputs, making it easy for a supervisor to review."

Each task should be atomic! \n-> Consider using nested for-loops to apply a set of tasks to a set of chunks.\n-> The same `task_id` should be applied to multiple chunks. DO NOT instantiate a new `task_id` for each combination of task and chunk.\n-> Use the conversational history to inform what chunking strategy has already been applied.\n-> You are provided access to the outputs of the previous jobs (see prev_job_outputs). \n-> If its helpful, you can reason over the prev_job_outputs vs. the original context.\n-> If tasks should be done sequentially, do not run them all in this round. Wait for the next round to run sequential tasks.\n\nFunction #2 (transform_outputs): The second function will aggregate the outputs of the small language models and provide an aggregated string for the supervisor to review.\n-> Filter the jobs based on the output of the small language models (write a custome filter function -- in some steps you might want to filter for a specific keyword, in others you might want to no pass anything back, so you filter out everything!). \n-> Aggregate the jobs based on the task_id and chunk_id.\n\n\n\n# Misc.
