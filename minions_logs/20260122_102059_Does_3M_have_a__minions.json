Total length: 353791 characters.: \n\n## Question\nDoes 3M have a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023? If the quick ratio is not relevant to measure liquidity, please state that and explain why.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 353791 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine if 3M has a reasonably healthy liquidity profile based on its quick ratio for Q2 of FY2023, you need to extract specific financial data from the document. Focus on identifying the company's current assets and current liabilities, as these are essential for calculating the quick ratio. Specifically, look for cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable, as these components form the numerator of the quick ratio. The denominator will be the total current liabilities. \n\nOnce you have these figures, calculate the quick ratio by dividing the sum of cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable by the current liabilities. A quick ratio above 1 generally indicates a healthy liquidity position, as it suggests the company can cover its short-term obligations without relying on the sale of inventory. \n\nIf the document suggests that the quick ratio is not relevant for assessing liquidity, it might be due to industry-specific factors or the company's unique financial structure. In such cases, the document should provide alternative metrics or explanations, such as the importance of inventory turnover or cash flow analysis, which might be more pertinent for evaluating 3M's liquidity."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

These adjustments consist of normal, recurring items. The results of operations\nfor any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. The interim consolidated financial statements and notes are presented as permitted by the\nrequirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements\nand notes included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, 3M re-consolidated the Aearo Technology and certain of its related entities (collectively, the \"Aearo Entities\") as a result of the court dismissal of\ntheir voluntary bankruptcy proceedings. 3M had previously deconsolidated these entities in the third quarter of 2022. The Aearo Entities have appealed the court’s dismissal\ndecision.

Also effective in the first quarter of 2023, 3M's Consumer\nbusiness segment re-aligned from four divisions to three divisions, see additional information in Note 15. 3M's disclosed disaggregated revenue was also updated as a result of\nthese changes, see additional information in Note 2. Information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe difference in the weighted average 3M shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3M common shareholders is a result of the\ndilution associated with the Company’s stock-based compensation plans. Certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans were not included in the\ncomputation of diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to 3M common shareholders because they would have had an anti-dilutive effect of 36.9 million and 36.5 million\naverage options for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, and 31.9 million and 27.5 million average options for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2022, respectively.

The effective tax\nrate for the first six months of 2023 was 25.2 percent, compared to 16.8 percent in the prior year. The primary factor that impacted the comparison of the six-month rates was\nthe second quarter 2023 charge related to the proposed settlement agreement with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (discussed in Note 14).\nThe total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 are $989 million and $965\nmillion, respectively. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change within the next 12 months. At this time, the Company is\nnot able to estimate the range by which these potential events could impact 3M’s unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.\nAt June 30, 2023, 3M’s deferred tax assets, a component of other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, also included a balance of approximately $2.4 billion as a result of\nthe pre-tax charge related to the proposed settlement agreement announced in the second quarter of 2023 with public water systems in the United States regarding PFAS (see\nNote 14).

Derivatives\nThe Company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate and interest rate\nfluctuations. Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K explains the types of derivatives and financial instruments used by\n3M, how and why 3M uses such instruments, and how such instruments are accounted for. It also contains information regarding previously initiated contracts or instruments.\nAdditional information with respect to derivatives is included elsewhere as follows:\n•\nImpact on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in Note 7.\n•\nFair value of derivative instruments is included in Note 13.\n•\nDerivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the Company’s long-term debt are described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2022\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nRefer to the section below titled Statement of Income (Loss) Location and Impact of Cash Flow and Fair Value Derivative Instruments and Derivatives Not Designated as\nHedging Instruments for details on the location within the consolidated statements of income (loss) for amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated\nas cash flow or fair value hedges (along with similar information relative to the hedged items) and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments. Additional information\nrelative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable.\nCash Flow Hedges:\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had a balance of $8 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in\naccumulated other comprehensive income (loss). This includes a remaining balance of $90 million (after-tax loss) related to forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate\nlock contracts, which will be amortized over the respective lives of the underlying notes. Based on exchange rates as of June 30, 2023, of the total after-tax net unrealized\nbalance as of June 30, 2023, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $75 million after-tax net unrealized gain over the next 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses\nfrom underlying hedged items).\nThe amount of pretax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges is provided in the following\ntable.\nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on Derivative\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix",

However, the\nCompany’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits,\nand by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate\ncredit risk in derivative transactions. A master netting arrangement may allow each counterparty to net settle amounts owed between a 3M entity and the counterparty as a result\nof multiple, separate derivative transactions. The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties.\n3M has elected to present the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis even when derivative transactions\nare subject to master netting arrangements and may otherwise qualify for net presentation. However, the following tables provide information as if the Company had elected to\noffset the asset and liability balances of derivative instruments, netted in accordance with various criteria in the event of default or termination as stipulated by the terms of\nnetting arrangements with each of the counterparties. For each counterparty, if netted, the Company would offset the asset and liability balances of all derivatives at the end of\nthe reporting period based on the 3M entity that is a party to the transactions. Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation.\n24\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOffsetting of Financial Assets under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\n Gross Amount of Derivative Assets\nPresented in the Consolidated Balance\nSheet\nGross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject to Master\nNetting Agreements\n Gross Amount of Eligible Offsetting\nRecognized Derivative Liabilities\nCash Collateral Received\nNet Amount of Derivative Assets\n (Millions)\nJune 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\nJune 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\nJune 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\nJune 30,\n2023\nDecember 31,\n2022\nDerivatives subject to master netting\nagreements\n$\n155 \n$\n217 \n$\n46 \n$\n40 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n109 \n$\n177 \nDerivatives not subject to master netting\nagreements\n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal\n$\n155 \n$\n217 \n$\n109 \n$\n177 \nOffsetting of Financial Liabilities under Master Netting Agreements with Derivative Counterparties\n Gross Amount of Derivative Liabilities\nPresented in the Consolidated Balance\nSheet\nGross Amounts not Offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheet that are Subject to Ma",

For 3M, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to indefinite-lived and long-lived asset impairments, goodwill impairments, and\nadjustment in carrying value of equity securities for which the measurement alternative of cost less impairment plus or minus observable price changes is used. There were no\nmaterial impairments of assets or adjustments to equity securities using the measurement alternative for the first six months of 2023 and 2022. As discussed in Note 15 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, in the third quarter of 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of net assets in\nRussia through an intended sale of related subsidiaries and, as a result, recorded this held-for-sale disposal group at the lower of its fair value less cost to sell or carrying\namount. In determining the carrying amount, the balance of cumulative translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss that would be eliminated upon sale\nwas included and a current liability of approximately $50 million was recorded largely representing a reserve against the balance of cumulative translation adjustment. In the\nsecond quarter of 2023, 3M closed on the sale of these subsidiaries, resulting in an immaterial gain after reversing this reserve while reclassifying the balance of cumulative\ntranslation adjustment into earnings.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments:\nThe Company’s financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and\nderivative contracts. The fair values of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated\ncarrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Available-for-sale marketable securities, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair\nvalues as indicated in the preceding disclosures. To estimate fair values (classified",

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings:\nThe Company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the United States, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. These claims,\nlawsuits and proceedings relate to matters including, but not limited to, products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold),\nintellectual property, commercial, antitrust, federal healthcare program related laws and regulations, such as the False Claims Act and anti-kickback laws, securities, and\nenvironmental laws in the United States and other jurisdictions. Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings. From time to\ntime, the Company also receives subpoenas, investigative demands or requests for information from various government agencies in the United States and foreign countries.\nThe Company generally responds in a cooperative, thorough and timely manner. These responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being\nincurred by the Company.

          "chunk": "f lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The\ncategories of legal proceedings in which the Company is involved may include multiple lawsuits and claims, may be spread across multiple jurisdictions and courts which may\nhandle the lawsuits and claims differently, may involve numerous and different types of plaintiffs, raising claims and legal theories based on specific allegations that may not\napply to other matters, and may seek substantial compensatory and, in some cases, punitive, damages. These and other factors contribute to the complexity of these lawsuits and\nclaims and make it difficult for the Company to predict outcomes and make reasonable estimates of any resulting losses. The Company's ability to predict outcomes and make\nreasonable estimates of potential losses is further influenced by the fact that a resolution of one or more matters within a category of legal proceedings may impact the\nresolution of other matters in that category in terms of timing, amount of liability, or both.\nWhen making determinations about recording liabilities related to legal proceedings, the Company complies with the requirements of ASC 450, Contingencies, and related\nguidance, and records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable. Where the reasonable estimate of the\nprobable loss is a range, the Company records as an accrual in its financial statements the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best\nestimate. The Company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accruals if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be\nmade. The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the Company believes\nthere is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred. Based on experience and developments, the Company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and\nassociated expenses and receivables each period, and whether a loss previously determined to not be reasonably estimable and/or not probable is now able to be reasonably\nestimated or has become probable. Where appropriate, the Company makes additions to or adjustments of its reasonably estimated losses and/or accruals. As a result, the\ncurrent accruals and/or estimates of loss and the estimates of the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the\nlegal proceedings and claims pending against the Company will likely change over time.\nBecause litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, the Company may ultimately incur charges substantially in excess\nof presently recorded liabilities, including with respect to matters fo",

A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the\nCompany generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well\nas products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims\nin the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other\nmalignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in fifteen\nof the sixteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits – one in California state\ncourt in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs\nagainst asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded\ncompensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company appealed. In\n2019, the Company settled a substantial majority of the then-pending coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in April\n2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above, and the appeal was dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King County, Washington,\ninvolving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3M’s 8710 respirator was defective and that 3M acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers. The jury\ndelivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3M was not a cause of\nplaintiff’s mesothelioma.

The Washington Supreme Court declined to review\nthe matter.\nThe Company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the\nintended circumstances. Consequently, the Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the\nCompany’s respiratory protection products. Nonetheless, the Company’s litigation experience indicates that claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including\nmesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving\npending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by medically\nunimpaired claimants. Since the second half of 2020, the Company has experienced an increase in the number of cases filed that allege injuries from exposures to coal mine\ndust; that increase represents a substantial majority of the growth in case numbers referred to above. The rate of coal mine dust-related case filings decelerated in 2022 and has\ncontinued to decelerate in 2023. 3M moved two cases involving over 400 plaintiffs to federal court based on, among others, the Class Action Fairness Act.

These activities\ninclude gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment activities, consideration of regulatory approaches, and increasingly strict restrictions on various uses of\nPFAS in products and on PFAS in manufacturing emissions, in some cases moving towards non-detectable limits for certain PFAS compounds. Regulations of PFAS in\nemissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are increasingly being set at levels that continue to decrease.

If such activity continues, including if\nregulations become final and enforceable, 3M may incur material costs to comply with new regulatory requirements or as a result of litigation or additional enforcement\nactions. Such regulatory changes may also have an impact on 3M’s reputation and may also increase its costs and potential litigation exposure to the extent legal defenses rely\non regulatory thresholds, or changes in regulation influence public perception.

In March 2023, the six-month consultation phase on the PFAS Restriction Proposal started. If the proposed rule becomes enforceable prior to 3M's announced\nexit from PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, depending on the scope and obligations contained in any final rule, PFAS manufacturers and manufacturers of PFAS\ncontaining products including 3M Belgium could incur additional costs and potential exposures, including future compliance costs, possible litigation and/or enforcement\nactions.\nEffective January 2023, the EU Food Contaminants Regulation targeting four PFAS (PFOS, PFOA, perfluorononanoic acid (\"PFNA\"), and, PFHxS) in foodstuff (eggs and\nanimal derived meat) prohibits the sale in all member states of foods containing levels of these chemicals exceeding the regulatory thresholds. As member states implement the\nregulation, Dyneon, a 3M subsidiary that operates the Gendorf facility in Germany, in coordination with local authorities and farmers, has proposed a pilot program of food\nsampling to determine if any remedial action is necessary.\nThe EU regulates PFAS in drinking water via a Drinking Water Directive, which includes a limit of 0.1 micrograms per liter (µg/l) (or 0.1 parts for billion (ppb)) for a sum of\n20 PFAS in drinking water.

Separately, as previously disclosed,\nthe Company is aware that certain residents of Zwijndrecht and non-governmental organizations filed a criminal complaint with an Antwerp investigatory judge against 3M\nBelgium, alleging it had unlawfully abandoned waste in violation of its environmental care obligations.

Subsequently, the environmental enforcement agency informed 3M Belgium that the agency believes that 3M Belgium must apply\nfor discharge limits for certain additional “short-chain” PFAS pursuant to the special condition. Although disagreeing with the agency’s position, 3M Belgium developed an\napplication to amend the permit to add the additional PFAS. 3M Belgium has insufficient information to predict the limits that will be set forth for additional short-chain PFAS\nand is therefore unable to assess whether the current or future wastewater treatment system, as currently conceived, will meet future limits imposed.

Moreover, 3M Belgium instituted a capturing process to prevent wastewaters containing short chain PFAS identified in the infraction report\nfrom entering the treatment system or its discharge. 3M Belgium notified the Inspectorate that complying with the special condition means ceasing the legally required\nextraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater. The Inspectorate acknowledged this fact but insisted that 3M Belgium continue to extract and treat groundwater.\nGroundwater treatment continues and 3M Belgium has applied for a modification of the water discharge permit to add parameters for the short chain PFAS. 3M Belgium will\ncontinue its efforts to comply with the special condition and to minimize discharge of all PFAS, including the PFAS identified in the infraction report, but an inability to meet\ndischarge limits for short chain PFAS could have a significant adverse impact on 3M Belgium’s normal operations and the Company's businesses that receive products and\nother materials from the facility, some of which may not be available in similar quantities from other 3M facilities, which could in turn impact these businesses’ ability to fulfill\nsupply obligations to their customers.\nSafety measure – emissions.

The plaintiffs and 3M filed preliminary summary judgment motions on the government contractor\ndefense. In July 2020, the MDL court granted the plaintiffs’ summary judgment motion and denied the defendants’ summary judgment motion, ruling that plaintiffs’ claims\nare not barred by the government contractor defense.

In December 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion to consolidate three plaintiffs for the first bellwether trial, which\nbegan in March 2021.\nIn April 2021, 3M received an adverse jury verdict in the first bellwether trial. The jury awarded the three plaintiffs less than $1 million in compensatory damages and\n$6 million in punitive damages for a total of $7 million. 3M appealed the verdicts, challenging, among other rulings, the MDL court's denial of 3M’s motion to assert the\ngovernment contractor defense.

Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the\noperating income information shown.\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes.\nBusiness segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in “Corporate and\nUnallocated”).\nEffective in the first quarter of 2023, the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed\nand, as a result, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)) was updated. The change to business segment operating income\n(loss) aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company’s business segments. The changes included the items described\nbelow. The financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these business segment reporting changes for all periods presented.\nReflecting gains/losses from sale of property, plant and equipment (PPE) and other assets within Corporate and Unallocated Change\n3M updated its business segment operating performance measure to reflect all gains/losses from sales of PPE and other assets within Corporate and Unallocated.\nPreviously, certain of these gains/losses were included in 3M’s business segments’ operating performance.\nMovement of certain businesses between segments\nThe businesses associated with two groups of products (each with approximately $25 million in sales) were realigned with one moving from the Consumer business\nsegment to the Health Care business segment and the other moving from the Health Care business segment to the Consumer business segment.\nAlso effective in the first quarter of 2023, the Consumer business segment re-aligned from four divisions to the following three divisions: Home, Health and Auto Care;\nConstruction and Home Improvement Markets; and Stationery and Office.\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Segment Information\n(Millions)\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\nNet Sales\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nSafety and Industrial\n$\n2,765 \n$\n2,924 \n$\n5,544 \n$\n5,975 \nTransportation and Electronics\n2,191 \n2,268 \n4,241 \n4,608 \nHealth Care\n2,075 \n2,179 \n4,085 \n4,307 \nConsumer\n1,293 \n1,330 \n2,485 \n2,639 \nCorporate an",

Net of the Company’s hedging\nstrategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools\nto manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of\nsupply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month\nhorizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is\nlargely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above. In either case, 3M’s hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign\ncurrency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3M’s businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFinancial condition:\nRefer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\nIn November 2018, 3M’s Board of Directors replaced the Company’s February 2016 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the\nrepurchase of up to $10 billion of 3M’s outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In the first six months of 2023, the Company purchased $29 million of its\nown stock, compared to $773 million of stock purchases in the first six months of 2022. As of June 30, 2023, approximately $4.2 billion remained available under the\nauthorization. In February 2023, 3M’s Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share, an increase of 1 percent. This marked the 65th consecutive\nyear of dividend increases for 3M. In May 2023, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2023 dividend of $1.50 per share.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Sales:\nRefer to the preceding Overview section and the Performance by Business Segment section later in MD&A for additional discussion of sales change.\nOperating Expenses:\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix months ended\nJune 30,\n(Percent of net sales)\n2023\n202",

The Company’s annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in February. Accounting rules require recognition of expense under a non-substantive\nvesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. This retiree-eligible population represents 35 percent of the annual\ngrant stock-based compensation expense; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter each year.\n3M expects global defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense in 2023 to decrease by approximately $160 million pre-tax when compared to 2022, which\nimpacts cost of sales, SG&A, and R&D. The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year.

In addition, disclosures relating to 3M’s business segments are provided in Note 15. Effective in\nthe first quarter of 2023, the measure of segment operating performance and segment composition used by 3M’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a\nresult, 3M’s disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income (loss)) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business\nsegment operating income (loss) aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company’s business segments (see Note 15 for\nadditional details).\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are\nSafety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\nCorporate and Unallocated:\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to “Corporate and Unallocated,” which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table\nand in Note 15. Corporate and Unallocated operating income (loss) includes “corporate special items” and “other corporate expense-net”. Corporate special items include net\ncosts for significant litigation impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters.

For example, the global pandemic associated with COVID-19, including related evolving governmental\nresponses to the pandemic, has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty, and has impacted and will continue to impact 3M’s operations, including its supply\nchain and its manufacturing and distribution capabilities. Although COVID-19 increased demand for certain 3M products, it also resulted in decreased demand from certain end\nmarkets, made it more difficult for 3M to serve customers, and resulted in conditions that had the potential to damage 3M's reputation, including third-party price gouging,\ncounterfeiting, and other illegal or fraudulent activities involving 3M's products. Furthermore, COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of\naffected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.\nAs the pandemic evolves, demand for personal protection products such as disposable respirators has experienced a decline from prior levels. 3M is not able to predict the\nimpact of unexpected events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and unexpected events may have a material adverse effect on 3M's consolidated results of operations or\nfinancial condition.\n* Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the Company’s ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings.\nBecause the Company’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and approximately 60 percent of the Company’s revenues are derived from outside the United\nStates, the Company’s results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the U.S. dollar strengthens\nsignificantly against foreign currencies.

          "chunk": ", governments in the United States and internationally have increasingly been regulating a broad group of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances\nproduced by the Company, collectively known as “PFAS.” 3M has noticed several global regulatory trends related to PFAS, including declining emission standards and limits\nset as to the presence of certain compounds in various media, and the inclusion of a broadening group of PFAS. Developments in these and other global regulatory trends may\nrequire additional actions by 3M, including investigation, remediation, and compliance, or may result in additional litigation and enforcement action costs.\nThe Company has been voluntarily cooperating with various local, state, federal (primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)), and international agencies in\ntheir review of the environmental and health effects of certain PFAS produced by the Company.\nThe PFAS group contains several categories and classes of durable chemicals and materials with properties that include oil, water, temperature, chemical, and fire resistance, as\nwell as electrical insulating properties. The strength of the carbon-fluorine bond also means that these compounds do not easily degrade. These characteristics have made PFAS\nsubstances critical to the manufacture of electronic devices such as cell phones, tablets, and semi-conductors. They are also used to help prevent contamination of medical\nproducts like surgical gowns and drapes. Commercial aircraft and low-emissions vehicles also rely on PFAS technology. PFAS compounds are manufactured by various\ncompanies, including 3M, and are used in everyday products, including some manufactured by 3M. As science and technology evolve and advance, and in response to evolving\nknowledge and the understanding that certain PFAS compounds had the potential to build up over time, 3M announced in 2000 that we would voluntarily phase out production\nof two PFAS substances, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) globally as a precautionary measure. We phased out of materials used to produce\ncertain repellants and surfactant products, with most of these activities in the U.S. completed by the end of 2002. Phased out products included Aqueous Film Forming Foam\n(AFFF) and certain coatings for food packaging, for example. The Company continues to review, control, or eliminate the presence of certain PFAS in purchased materials, as\nintended substances in products, or as byproducts of some of 3M’s current manufacturing processes, products, and waste streams.\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\n3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025; and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product\nportfolio by the end of 2025. 3M’s decision is based on careful consideration and a thorough evaluation of the evolving external landscape, including multiple factors such as\naccelerating regulatory trends focused on reducing or el",

In addition, the ability to adapt to business model and other changes, including responding to evolving\ncustomer needs and service expectations, are important, and, if not done successfully, could negatively impact the Company’s ability to win new business and enhance revenue\nand 3M’s brand. Operational challenges, including those related to customer service, pace of change and productivity improvements, could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Financial and Capital Markets and Tax Matters\n* The Company's defined benefit pension and postretirement plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our results.\nThe performance of financial markets and discount rates impact the Company's funding obligations under its defined benefit plans. Significant changes in market interest rates,\ndecreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets, and legislative or regulatory changes relating to defined benefit plan funding may increase the\nCompany's funding obligations and adversely impact its results of operations and cash flows.\n* Change in the Company’s credit ratings could increase cost of funding.\nThe Company’s credit ratings are important to 3M’s cost of capital. The major rating agencies routinely evaluate the Company’s credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3M.\nThis evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of\nfinancial reporting. The Company’s credit ratings have served to lower 3M’s borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. As of June 2023, 3M has a credit\nrating of A2, negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A-, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings. Moody’s Investor Service\ndowngraded the Company’s credit rating from A1 to A2, and S&P Global Ratings downgraded the Company’s credit rating from A to A- (and downgraded the Company’s\nshort-term credit rating from A-2 to A-1), in connection with the Company’s announcement of",

Failure to maintain strong investment grade ratings and further downgrades by the ratings agencies, would adversely\naffect the Company’s cost of funding and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.\n* Changes in tax rates, laws, or regulations could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe Company’s business is subject to tax-related external conditions, such as tax rates, tax laws and regulations, changing political environments in the U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions that impact tax examination, and assessment and enforcement approaches. In addition, changes in tax laws including further regulatory developments arising from\nU.S. or international tax reform legislation could result in a tax expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In connection with the Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Integrated Framework provided by Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), determination of multi-\njurisdictional taxation rights and the rate of tax applicable to certain types of income may be subject to potential change. Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and\nregulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an\nadverse impact on the Company's financial results.\n83\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to the Voluntary Chapter 11 Proceedings Initiated by the Company’s Aearo Entities\n* The Company is subject to risks related to its subsidiaries’ chapter 11 proceedings.\nOn July 26, 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (\"Aearo Entities\"), all wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, voluntarily initiated chapter 11\nproceedings seeking bankruptcy court supervision to establish a trust – funded by the Company – to address potential liabilities related to Dual-Ended Combat Arms – Version\n2 earplugs and mask/respirator products historically manufactured and sold by Aearo Entities. This represented a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2\nearplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. Aearo Entities were acquired by the Company in 2008 and they, along with its related subsidiaries,\nhave operated as Company subsidiaries since that time. 3M has entered into a funding agreement with Aearo Entities and committed to fund a trust to satisfy all claims\ndetermined to be entitled to compensation, and to support Aearo Entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M committed $1.0 billion to fund this\ntrust and an additional $0.2 billion to fund projected related case expenses. Under the terms of the funding agreement, 3M would provide additional funding if required by the\nAearo Entities. As discussed in Note 14, “Co",

Aearo has appealed the\ndecision. Following dismissal of the bankruptcy, Combat Arms earplugs claims against the Aearo Entities will proceed in the federal and state multidistrict litigation, and will\ncontinue to proceed against 3M, which is a defendants in those litigation matters. 3M has been engaged in active confidential mediation pursuant to the orders of the federal and\nstate MDL courts. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the chapter 11 proceedings, including, among others, those related to: legal risks related to the\nchapter 11 proceedings; potential impacts to the Company’s reputation and relationships with its customers, suppliers, federal contracting officials, employees, regulators, and\nother counterparties and community members; impacts to the Company’s liquidity or results of operations, including risks related to the amount that will be necessary to fully\nand finally resolve all of the Company’s obligations to make payments to resolve such claims under the terms of its funding and indemnification agreement with Aearo Entities;\nthe costs of chapter 11 proceedings and length of time necessary to resolve the cases; and Aearo Entities’ ability to reach acceptable agreements with claimants and navigate the\nchapter 11 proceedings to obtain approval and consummation of a plan of reorganization. In addition, due to the dismissal of the Aearo Entities bankruptcy proceeding, attempts\nto comprehensibly resolve with finality all Combat Arms earplugs claims against the Aearo Entities and 3M outside of the bankruptcy proceeding and in a litigation settlement\ninvolve significant challenges that could cause the Company to incur substantial and material costs. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, the Company cannot predict\nthe timing, outcome, or financial impact of this matter, or any other ongoing or future related litigation.\nRisks Related to the Planned Spin-off of the Company’s Health Care Business\n* The Company is subject to risks related to its plan to spin off its Health Care business.\nOn July 26, 2022, the Company announced its intent to spin off its Health Care business, resulting in two standalone public companies, in a transaction that is intended to be\ntax-free for the Company’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The spin-off will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, including the filing and\neffectiveness of a Form 10 registration statement, receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service and a tax opinion from external counsel, satisfactory\ncompletion of financing, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, and other customary conditions.

The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions, as well as\nadditional factors such as conditions in the equity and debt markets, other external conditions, or developments involving the Company or any of its businesses, many of which\nare outside of the Company’s control, could delay the completion of the spin-off relative to the anticipated timeline or prevent it from occurring. Any delay in the completion of\nthe spin-off or any change to the anticipated terms of the transaction could reduce the expected benefits of the transaction, or delay the time at which such benefits are realized.\nThere can also be no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction will be realized if the spin-off is completed, or that the costs or dis-synergies of the transaction\n(including costs of related restructuring transactions), will not exceed the anticipated amounts. Whether or not the spin-off is ultimately completed, the pendency of the\ntransaction may impose challenges on the Company and its business, including potential business disruption; the diversion of management time on matters relating to the\ntransaction; the impact on the Company’s ability to retain talent; and potential impacts on the Company’s relationships with its customers, employees, regulators, and other\ncounterparties. In addition, while it is intended that the transaction would be tax-free to the Company’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there is no assurance\nthat the transactions will qualify for this treatment. If the spin-off was ultimately determined to be taxable, the Company, the Health Care business, or the Company’s\nstockholders could incur income tax liabilities that could be significant.

What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "We have gathered several pieces of financial data from the junior workers' outputs, but there are inconsistencies and gaps in the information:\n\n1. **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: We have two main figures: $4.3 billion and $4.258 billion. These are relatively close, suggesting they might be accurate, but there is some discrepancy.\n\n2. **Marketable Securities**: The figures vary significantly, with $1.1 billion and $56 million being reported. This discrepancy needs resolution for an accurate quick ratio calculation.\n\n3. **Accounts Receivable**: The figures reported are $5.3 billion and $4.947 billion. These are close enough to suggest reliability.\n\n4. **Current Liabilities**: The figures reported are $14.4 billion, $10.936 billion, and $16.356 billion. The variation here is significant, and we need to determine which is correct.\n\nTo answer the question about 3M's liquidity profile based on the quick ratio, we need consistent and accurate values for these components. The quick ratio is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \\text{Marketable Securities} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n\\]\n\nGiven the discrepancies, particularly in marketable securities and current liabilities, we cannot confidently calculate the quick ratio without resolving these differences. We need to identify which figures are most reliable, possibly by checking the citations or context from which these numbers were extracted.\n\nIf we assume the most frequently reported or average values are correct, we could proceed with the calculation, but this would be speculative without further verification. Therefore, the specific information missing is a reliable source or citation to confirm the correct figures for marketable securities and current liabilities."

It focuses on two main tasks: extracting current assets (cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable) and extracting current liabilities. Each task is atomic and applied to each chunk of the document.\n\n- **transform_outputs**: This function filters and aggregates the outputs from the small language models. It filters out jobs with empty or null answers and organizes the results by task and chunk. The aggregated string includes all relevant information from the job outputs, making it easy for a supervisor to review."

Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was 24.2 percent on a pre-tax loss, compared to (38.3) percent on pre-tax income in the prior year. The primary factor that\nimpacted the comparison of these rates was the second quarter 2022 charge related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (see Note 14). The effective tax\nrate for the first six months of 2023 was 25.2 percent, compared to 16.8 percent in the prior year.

Based on exchange rates as of June 30, 2023, of the total after-tax net unrealized\nbalance as of June 30, 2023, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $75 million after-tax net unrealized gain over the next 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses\nfrom underlying hedged items).\nThe amount of pretax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges is provided in the following\ntable.\nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on Derivative\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix",

A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the\nCompany generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well\nas products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims\nin the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other\nmalignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in fifteen\nof the sixteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits – one in California state\ncourt in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs\nagainst asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded\ncompensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company appealed. In\n2019, the Company settled a substantial majority of the then-pending coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in April\n2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above, and the appeal was dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King County, Washington,\ninvolving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3M’s 8710 respirator was defective and that 3M acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers.

A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the\nCompany generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well\nas products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims\nin the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other\nmalignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in fifteen\nof the sixteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below).

Moreover, 3M Belgium instituted a capturing process to prevent wastewaters containing short chain PFAS identified in the infraction report\nfrom entering the treatment system or its discharge. 3M Belgium notified the Inspectorate that complying with the special condition means ceasing the legally required\nextraction and treatment of contaminated groundwater.

Since March 2023, attorneys general have also brought suit against 3M on behalf of the\npeople of Arizona, Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Kentucky, Maine (a second case, a purported “non-AFFF” case), Maryland (both AFFF and purported “non-AFFF”\ncases), New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.\nThere are also multiple state attorneys general lawsuits that are proceeding outside the AFFF MDL, as described below.\nNew Jersey. In March 2019, the New Jersey Attorney General filed two actions against 3M, E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Co. (“DuPont”), and Chemours Co.

Five cases remain pending in state courts where they are stayed\nby agreement of the parties.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company is aware of approximately 185 other AFFF suits originally filed in various state courts in which the Company has been named a defendant.\n3M anticipates that most of these cases will eventually be removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL; however, several cases are expected to remain pending in\nstate courts.\nSeparately, the Company is aware of pre-suit claims or demands by other parties related to the use and disposal of AFFF, one of which purports to represent a large group of\nfirefighters. The Company had discussions with certain potential pre-suit claimants and, as a result of such discussions, reached a negotiated resolution for an immaterial\namount with the City of Bemidji in March 2021.\nOther PFAS-related Product and Environmental Litigation\n3M manufactured and sold various products containing PFOA and PFOS, including Scotchgard, for several decades. Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and\nputative class action complaints in various state and federal courts alleging, among other things, that 3M’s customers’ improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS resulted in the\ncontamination of groundwater or surface water. The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of the\nproduct. They also generally allege that contaminated groundwater has caused various injuries, including personal injury, loss of use and enjoyment of their properties,\ndiminished property values, investigation costs, and remediation costs. Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp.,\nHoneywell International Inc. f/k/a Allied-Signal Inc. and/or AlliedSignal Laminate Systems, Inc., Wolverine World Wide Inc.

The plaintiff brings claims for negligence, battery, and conspiracy and seeks injunctive relief, including an order\n“establishing an independent panel of scientists” to evaluate PFAS. In March 2022, the court certified a class of \"[i]ndividuals subject to the laws of Ohio, who have 0.05 [ppt]\nof PFOA (C-8) and at least 0.05 ppt of any other PFAS in their blood serum.\" The judge ordered additional briefing to permit defendants to narrow the proposed nationwide\nclass by “show[ing] what states do not recognize the type of claim for relief filed by” the plaintiff. In September 2022, the Sixth Circuit granted the defendants’ request to\nappeal the district court’s class certification order. Defendants’ appeal is now fully briefed.\nOther PFAS-related Matters\nIn July 2019, the Company received a written request from the Subcommittee on Environment of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, U.S. House of Representatives,\nseeking certain documents and information relating to the Company’s manufacturing and distribution of PFAS products. In September 2019, a 3M representative testified\nbefore and responded to questions from the Subcommittee on Environment with respect to PFAS and the Company’s environmental stewardship initiatives. The Company\ncontinues to cooperate with the Subcommittee.\nThe Company continues to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste associated with\nmanufacturing operations at its Decatur, Alabama; Cottage Grove, Minnesota; and Cordova, Illinois plants.\nAs previously reported, the Illinois EPA in August 2014 approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in\nCordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results. In June 2022, the Illinois EPA\nprovided notice of the termination of the Cordova May 2000 Site Remediation Agreement. The Company continues to perform pumping of impacted site groundwater,\ngroundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results to Illinois EPA. In addition, the Company is treating its pumped groundwater at its Cordova wastewater treatment plant.\nIn Minnesota, the Company continues to work with the MPCA pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address\nthe presence of certain PFAS compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s\nmanufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota.

During the first six months of 2023, as a\nresult of ongoing review and recent developments in ongoing environmental matters and litigation (including the proposed PWS Settlement), the Company increased its accrual\nfor PFAS-related other environmental liabilities by $10.3 billion and made related payments of $38 million.

Liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or\nthird-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the\ncontamination and the nature of required remedial actions. The Company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. The Company\nexpects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.\nIt is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental\nlaws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods.

Net of the Company’s hedging\nstrategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools\nto manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of\nsupply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month\nhorizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is\nlargely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above.

The year-on-year decrease in defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense for the second quarter and first six\nmonths of 2023 was approximately $38 million and $80 million, respectively.\nFor total year 2022, the Company recognized consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement service cost expense of $426 million and a benefit of $248\nmillion related to all non-service pension and postretirement net benefit costs (after settlements, curtailments, special termination benefits and other) for a total consolidated\ndefined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense of $178 million.\nFor total year 2023, defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost expense is anticipated to total approximately $270 million while non-service pension and\npostretirement net benefit cost is anticipated to be a benefit of approximately $125 million, for a total consolidated defined benefit pre-tax pension and postretirement expense\nof approximately $145 million, a decrease in expense of approximately $30 million compared to 2022.\nThe Company is continuing the ongoing deployment of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system on a worldwide basis, with these investments impacting cost of sales,\nSG&A, and R&D.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales, measured as a percent of sales, decreased in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 when compared to the same period last year. Decreases were\nprimarily due to lower year-on-year net costs for significant litigation to address certain PFAS-related matters at 3M's Zwijndrecht, Belgium site, higher selling prices, spending\ndisc",

If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered**:\n   - **Cash and Cash Equivalents**: We have values of \\$4.3 billion and \\$4.258 billion.\n   - **Marketable Securities**: Values of \\$1.1 billion and \\$56 million were found.\n   - **Accounts Receivable**: Values of \\$5.3 billion and \\$4.947 billion were extracted.\n   - **Current Liabilities**: Values of \\$14.4 billion, \\$10.936 billion, and \\$16.356 billion were identified.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - To calculate the quick ratio, we need consistent and reliable values for cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and current liabilities. The quick ratio is calculated as:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents} + \\text{Marketable Securities} + \\text{Accounts Receivable}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}\n     \\]\n   - We have multiple values for each component, which indicates discrepancies that need resolution.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - We need to resolve discrepancies in the values of marketable securities and current liabilities. The most reliable values should be selected based on citations or the context of the financial statements.\n\n4. **Calculation**:\n   - Assuming we resolve discrepancies, we would use the most reliable and consistent values to calculate the quick ratio. For example, if we choose cash and cash equivalents of \\$4.3 billion, marketable securities of \\$1.1 billion, accounts receivable of \\$5.3 billion, and current liabilities of \\$14.4 billion, the quick ratio would be:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{4.3 + 1.1 + 5.3}{14.4} = \\frac{10.7}{14.4} \\approx 0.74\n     \\]\n   - A quick ratio below 1 suggests that 3M may not have a strong liquidity position, as it indicates the company might not be able to cover its short-term liabilities without selling inventory.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - To resolve conflicts, we should prioritize values with clear citations from reliable sections of the financial documents, such as the Consolidated Balance Sheet or Cash Flow Statements. For instance, the value of \\$4.258 billion for cash and cash equivalents is cited from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which might be more reliable.\n\nIn conclusion, while we have gathered substantial information, discrepancies in the data need resolution to confidently calculate the quick ratio and assess 3M's liquidity profile."

Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 was 24.2 percent on a pre-tax loss, compared to (38.3) percent on pre-tax income in the prior year. The primary factor that\nimpacted the comparison of these rates was the second quarter 2022 charge related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (see Note 14). The effective tax\nrate for the first six months of 2023 was 25.2 percent, compared to 16.8 percent in the prior year.

Based on exchange rates as of June 30, 2023, of the total after-tax net unrealized\nbalance as of June 30, 2023, 3M expects to reclassify approximately $75 million after-tax net unrealized gain over the next 12 months (with the impact offset by earnings/losses\nfrom underlying hedged items).\nThe amount of pretax gain (loss) recognized in other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges is provided in the following\ntable.\nPretax Gain (Loss) Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on Derivative\nThree months ended\nJune 30,\nSix",

A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the\nCompany generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well\nas products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims\nin the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other\nmalignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in fifteen\nof the sixteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits – one in California state\ncourt in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs\nagainst asbestos fibers. In April 2018, a jury in state court in Kentucky found 3M’s 8710 respirators failed to protect two coal miners from coal mine dust and awarded\ncompensatory damages of approximately $2 million and punitive damages totaling $63 million. In August 2018, the trial court entered judgment and the Company appealed. In\n2019, the Company settled a substantial majority of the then-pending coal mine dust lawsuits in Kentucky and West Virginia for $340 million, including the jury verdict in April\n2018 in the Kentucky case mentioned above, and the appeal was dismissed. In October 2020, 3M defended a respirator case before a jury in King County, Washington,\ninvolving a former shipyard worker who alleged 3M’s 8710 respirator was defective and that 3M acted negligently in failing to protect him against asbestos fibers. The jury\ndelivered a complete defense verdict in favor of 3M, concluding that the 8710 respirator was not defective in design or warnings and any conduct by 3M was not a cause of\nplaintiff’s mesothelioma.

A minority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the\nCompany generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the Company, which are often unspecified, as well\nas products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at Company premises.\nThe Company’s current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003. The Company expects that filing of claims\nin the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. Accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other\nmalignancies, and black lung disease, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. Over the past twenty plus years, the Company has prevailed in fifteen\nof the sixteen cases tried to a jury (including the lawsuits in 2018 described below). In 2018, 3M received a jury verdict in its favor in two lawsuits – one in California state\ncourt in February and the other in Massachusetts state court in December – both involving allegations that 3M respirators were defective and failed to protect the plaintiffs\nagainst asbestos fibers.

In September 2019, a 3M representative testified\nbefore and responded to questions from the Subcommittee on Environment with respect to PFAS and the Company’s environmental stewardship initiatives. The Company\ncontinues to cooperate with the Subcommittee.\nThe Company continues to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to remediate historic disposal of PFAS-containing waste associated with\nmanufacturing operations at its Decatur, Alabama; Cottage Grove, Minnesota; and Cordova, Illinois plants.\nAs previously reported, the Illinois EPA in August 2014 approved a request by the Company to establish a groundwater management zone at its manufacturing facility in\nCordova, Illinois, which includes ongoing pumping of impacted site groundwater, groundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results. In June 2022, the Illinois EPA\nprovided notice of the termination of the Cordova May 2000 Site Remediation Agreement. The Company continues to perform pumping of impacted site groundwater,\ngroundwater monitoring and routine reporting of results to Illinois EPA. In addition, the Company is treating its pumped groundwater at its Cordova wastewater treatment plant.\nIn Minnesota, the Company continues to work with the MPCA pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed May 2007 Settlement Agreement and Consent Order to address\nthe presence of certain PFAS compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in Washington County, Minnesota (Oakdale and Woodbury) and at the Company’s\nmanufacturing facility at Cottage Grove, Minnesota.

In October 2022, the Eleventh Circuit granted 3M’s motion to stay the order\npending appeal. The Eleventh Circuit heard oral argument for this appeal in June 2023.\nIn September 2022, two MDL plaintiffs filed a lawsuit with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, seeking to permanently enjoin 3M from transferring\nassets, issuing dividends or completing the announced spin-off of its Health Care business, to allegedly preserve assets for the Combat Arms claimants. The Company has\nfiled a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and an opposition to the injunction motion. In December 2022, the court dismissed the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds. Also in\nDecember 2022, the MDL court granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment that successor liability, claiming that 3M is fully and independently liable for injuries\nallegedly caused by the CAEv2 and certified the order for appeal to the Eleventh Circuit. In January 2023, 3M sought the Eleventh Circuit’s acceptance of the appeal.\nActivity in the MDL is stayed pending resolution of this appeal. In June 2023, the MDL court lifted the stay as to the Aearo Entities but the MDL stay pending resolution of\nthe Eleventh Circuit’s acceptance of the appeal of the successor liability decision remains in place.\n3M is also defending lawsuits brought primarily by non-military plaintiffs in state court in Hennepin County, Minnesota. 3M removed these actions to federal court, and\nthe federal court remanded them to state court in March 2020. On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ruled in October 2021 that the cases brought by\nnon-military plaintiffs were properly remanded to state court, whereas the cases brought by military contractor plaintiffs who had received the Combat Arms Earplugs from\nthe military should have remained in federal court. In November 2021, the Eighth Circuit granted 3M's unopposed motion to vacate the remand orders in the remaining\nappeals of military service memb",

As 3M has previously disclosed, one qui tam action (the Godecke case) was dismissed in\nJanuary 2022. In the remaining action (the Hartpence case), the complaint contains allegations that the KCI Defendants violated the federal False Claims Act by submitting\nfalse or fraudulent claims to federal healthcare programs by billing for V.A.C.® Therapy in a manner that was not consistent with the Local Coverage Determinations issued by\nthe Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors and seeks monetary damages.\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2019, the district court entered summary judgment in the KCI Defendants’ favor on all of the relator-plaintiff’s claims. The relator-plaintiff then filed an appeal in the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Oral argument in the Hartpence case was held in July 2020. The appellate court issued an opinion in August 2022 reversing the\ndecision of the district court and remanding the case for further proceedings. The district court held a status conference in January 2023 where no case deadlines were set; the\nlitigation remains in a pre-trial stage. The KCI Defendants filed a renewed motion for summary judgment in March 2023. Briefing on the motion for summary judgment is\ncomplete, but the district court granted a joint motion to vacate the hearing date to allow the parties to discuss a potential resolution of the case. The parties must provide a joint\nstatus report by the end of July 2023.\nFor the KCI-related matters described in this section for which a liability has been recorded, the amount recorded is not material to the Company’s consolidated results of\noperations or financial condition. The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of the recorded liability at this time.\nCompliance Matter\nThe Company, through its internal processes, discovered certain travel activities and related funding and record keeping issues raising concerns, arising from marketing efforts\nby certain business groups based in China. The Company initiated an internal investigation to determine whether the expenditures may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act (FCPA) or other potentially applicable anti-corruption laws. The Company has retained outside counsel and a forensic accounting firm to assist with the\ninvestigation. In July 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed this investigation to both the Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission and is cooperating\nwith both agencies. The Company is in discussions related to potential resolution.\nNOTE 15.

Net of the Company’s hedging\nstrategy, foreign currency negatively impacted earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 compared to the same period last year. 3M utilizes a number of tools\nto manage currency risk related to earnings including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of\nsupply. 3M also uses financial hedges to mitigate currency risk. In the case of more liquid currencies, 3M hedges a portion of its aggregate exposure, using a 12, 24 or 36 month\nhorizon, depending on the currency in question. For less liquid currencies, financial hedging is frequently more expensive with more limitations on tenor. Thus, this risk is\nlargely managed via local operational actions using natural hedging tools as discussed above.

Due to the evolving nature of global tax laws and\nregulations and compliance approaches, it is currently not possible to assess the ultimate impact of these actions on our financial statements, but these actions could have an\nadverse impact on the Company's financial results.\n83\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to the Voluntary Chapter 11 Proceedings Initiated by the Company’s Aearo Entities\n* The Company is subject to risks related to its subsidiaries’ chapter 11 proceedings.\nOn July 26, 2022, Aearo Technologies and certain of its related entities (\"Aearo Entities\"), all wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company, voluntarily initiated chapter 11\nproceedings seeking bankruptcy court supervision to establish a trust – funded by the Company – to address potential liabilities related to Dual-Ended Combat Arms – Version\n2 earplugs and mask/respirator products historically manufactured and sold by Aearo Entities. This represented a change in strategy for managing the Combat Arms Version 2\nearplugs and Aearo respirator mask/asbestos alleged litigation liabilities. Aearo Entities were acquired by the Company in 2008 and they, along with its related subsidiaries,\nhave operated as Company subsidiaries since that time. 3M has entered into a funding agreement with Aearo Entities and committed to fund a trust to satisfy all claims\ndetermined to be entitled to compensation, and to support Aearo Entities as they continue to operate during the chapter 11 proceedings. 3M committed $1.0 billion to fund this\ntrust and an additional $0.2 billion to fund projected related case expenses. Under the terms of the funding agreement, 3M would provide additional funding if required by the\nAearo Entities. As discussed in Note 14, “Co",

Aearo has appealed the\ndecision. Following dismissal of the bankruptcy, Combat Arms earplugs claims against the Aearo Entities will proceed in the federal and state multidistrict litigation, and will\ncontinue to proceed against 3M, which is a defendants in those litigation matters. 3M has been engaged in active confidential mediation pursuant to the orders of the federal and\nstate MDL courts. There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the chapter 11 proceedings, including, among others, those related to: legal risks related to the\nchapter 11 proceedings; potential impacts to the Company’s reputation and relationships with its customers, suppliers, federal contracting officials, employees, regulators, and\nother counterparties and community members; impacts to the Company’s liquidity or results of operations, including risks related to the amount that will be necessary to fully\nand finally resolve all of the Company’s obligations to make payments to resolve such claims under the terms of its funding and indemnification agreement with Aearo Entities;\nthe costs of chapter 11 proceedings and length of time necessary to resolve the cases; and Aearo Entities’ ability to reach acceptable agreements with claimants and navigate the\nchapter 11 proceedings to obtain approval and consummation of a plan of reorganization.
