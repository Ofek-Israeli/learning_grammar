      "output": "To determine if Pfizer is spinning off any large business segments as of Q2'2023, focus on sections of the financial document that discuss corporate restructuring, strategic initiatives, or business segment performance. Look for any announcements or discussions related to divestitures, spin-offs, or strategic realignments. Pay attention to management commentary, press releases, or notes to the financial statements that might detail changes in business structure. Additionally, review any forward-looking statements or strategic plans that could indicate future intentions regarding business segments. Ensure that you verify the timing and specifics of any spin-off activities mentioned to confirm their relevance to Q2'2023."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities can vary during each quarter of the year. Therefore, the results and trends in these\ninterim financial statements may not be representative of those for the full year.\nPfizer’s fiscal quarter-end for subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is as of and for the three and six months ended May 28, 2023 and May 29, 2022, and for\nU.S. subsidiaries is as of and for the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022.\nWe manage our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation. Biopharma is the\nonly reportable segment. See Note 13A below and Note 17A in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nBusiness development activities impacted financial results in the periods presented. In March 2023, we and Seagen announced that the companies entered into\nan agreement under which we will acquire Seagen, a global biotechnology company that discovers, develops and commercializes transformative cancer\nmedicines, for $229 in cash per Seagen share for a total enterprise value of approximately $43 billion. We expect to finance the transaction substantially\nthrough $31 billion of long-term debt issued in May 2023 (see Note 7D), and the balance from a combination of short-term financing and existing cash. The\ntransaction was approved by Seagen’s shareholders in May 2023. The transaction is expected to close in late 2023 or early 2024, and remains subject to\ncustomary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. See Note 2 below, as well as Notes 1A and 2 in our 2022 Form 10-K.\nWe have made certain reclassification adjustments to conform prior-period amounts to the current presentation for segment reporting.\nB. New Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023\nOn January 1, 2023, we adopted a new accounting standard for supplier finance programs which requires increased disclosures in the notes to our financial\nstatements. See Note 8C.\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we adopted new accounting standards on reference rate reform that provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the\nguidance for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate that were discontinued after June 30, 2023.\nWe applied certain of the optional expedients related to hedge accounting relationships. The main purpose of the expedients is to allow hedge accounting to\ncontinue uninterrupted and make it easier to apply the requirements to maintain hedge accounting during the transition period through December 31, 2024.\nC.

The allowance for credit losses reflects our best estimate of\nexpected credit losses of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, current information, and forecasts of future economic\nconditions. In developing the estimate for expected credit losses, trade accounts receivables are segmented into pools of assets depending on market (U.S.\nversus international), delinquency status, and customer type (high risk versus low risk and government versus non-government), and fixed reserve percentages\nare established for each pool of trade accounts receivables.\nIn determining the reserve percentages for each pool of trade accounts receivables, we considered our historical experience with certain customers and\ncustomer types, regulatory and legal environments, country and political risk, and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factors. When\nmanagement becomes aware of certain customer-specific factors that impact credit risk, specific allowances for these known troubled accounts are recorded.\nDuring the three and six months ended July 2, 2023 and July 3, 2022, additions to the allowance for credit losses, write-offs and recoveries of customer\nreceivables were not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $12.1 billion.\nHaleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into\nU.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income.\nThe increase in the value of our investment from December 31, 2022 is primarily due to $271 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see\nNote 6) and our share of Haleon’s earnings of $219 million, partially offset by $88 million in dividends received. We record our share of earnings from\nHaleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions––net.

As there is substantive transfer\nof risk to the financial partner, the development funding is recognized by us as an obligation to perform contractual services.

The reduction to Research and\ndevelopment expenses for the second quarter of 2023 was $45 million. If successful, upon regulatory approval in the U.S. or certain major markets in the EU\nfor the indications based on the applicable clinical trials, Blackstone will be eligible to receive approval-based fixed milestone payments of up to $468 million\ncontingent upon the successful results of the clinical trials.

The negative effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2023 and the\nlower effective tax rates for the second quarter and first six months of 2023, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2022, were primarily due to\ntax benefits in the second quarter of 2023 related to global income tax resolutions in multiple jurisdictions spanning multiple tax years and a favorable change\nin the jurisdictional mix of earnings.\nWe elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, to pay our initial estimated $15 billion repatriation tax liability on\naccumulated post-1986 foreign earnings over eight years through 2026. The fifth annual installment of this liability was paid by its April 18, 2023 due date.\nThe sixth annual installment is due April 15, 2024 and is reported in current Income taxes payable as of July 2, 2023. The remaining liability is reported in\nnoncurrent Other taxes payable. Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign\ntax and other credit carryforwards.\nB. Tax Contingencies\nWe are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions, and a certain degree of estimation is required in recording the assets and liabilities related to income taxes.\nAll of our tax positions are subject to audit by the local taxing authorities in each tax jurisdiction. These tax audits can involve complex issues, interpretations\nand judgments and the resolution of matters may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.\nThe U.S. is one of our major tax jurisdictions, and we are regularly audited by the IRS. With respect to Pfizer, tax years 2016-2018 are under audit. Tax years\n2019-2023 are open but not under audit. All other tax years are closed. In addition to the open audit years in the U.S., we have open audit years and certain\nrelated audits, appeals and investigations in certain major international tax jurisdictions dating back to 2012.\nSee Note 5D in our 2022 Form 10-K.\n(a)\n(b)\n(b)\n(b)\n(a)\n(b)\n15\n\n\nPFIZER INC.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nForeign Exchange Risk––A significant portion of our revenues, earnings and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange\nrates. Where foreign exchange risk is not offset by other exposures, we manage our foreign exchange risk principally through the use of derivative financial\ninstruments and foreign currency debt. These financial instruments serve to mitigate the impact on net income as a result of remeasurement into another\ncurrency, or against the impact of translation into U.S. dollars of certain foreign exchange-denominated transactions.\nThe derivative financial instruments primarily hedge or offset exposures in the euro, U.K. Pound, Japanese Yen, Chinese renminbi, Singapore dollar and\nCanadian dollar, and include a portion of our forecasted foreign exchange-denominated intercompany inventory sales hedged up to two years. We may seek to\nprotect against possible declines in the reported net investments of our foreign business entities.\nInterest Rate Risk––Our interest-bearing investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk. Depending on market conditions, we may change the\nprofile of our outstanding debt or investments by entering into derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps, either to hedge or offset the exposure to\nchanges in the fair value of hedged items with fixed interest rates, or to convert variable rate debt or investments to fixed rates. The derivative financial\ninstruments primarily hedge U.S. dollar fixed-rate debt.\nThe following summarizes the fair value of the derivative financial instruments and notional amounts:\nJuly 2, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nFair Value\nFair Value\n(MILLIONS)\nNotional\nAsset\nLiability\nNotional\nAsset\nLiability\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n24,145 \n$\n630 \n$\n1,095 \n$\n26,603 \n$\n838 \n$\n1,196 \nInterest rate contracts\n2,250 \n— \n333 \n2,250 \n— \n331 \n630 \n1,428 \n838 \n1,527 ",

The following outlines our legal contingencies, guarantees and indemnifications. For a discussion of our tax contingencies,\nsee Note 5B.\nA. Legal Proceedings\nOur legal contingencies include, but are not limited to, the following:\n• Patent litigation, which typically involves challenges to the coverage and/or validity of patents on various products, processes or dosage forms. An adverse\noutcome could result in loss of patent protection for a product, a significant loss of revenues from a product or impairment of the value of associated assets.\nWe are the plaintiff in the majority of these actions.\n• Product liability and other product-related litigation related to current or former products, which can include personal injury, consumer, off-label promotion,\nsecurities, antitrust and breach of contract claims, among others, and often involves highly complex issues relating to medical causation, label warnings and\nreliance on those warnings, scientific evidence and findings, actual, provable injury and other matters.\n• Commercial and other asserted or unasserted matters, which can include acquisition-, licensing-, intellectual property-, collaboration- or co-promotion-\nrelated and product-pricing claims and environmental claims and proceedings, and can involve complexities that will vary from matter to matter.\n• Government investigations, which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical companies by national, state and local government agencies\nin the U.S. and in other jurisdictions.\nCertain of these contingencies could result in increased expenses and/or losses, including damages, royalty payments, fines and/or civil penalties, which could\nbe substantial, and/or criminal charges.\nWe believe that our claims and defenses in matters in which we are a defendant are substantial, but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdicts\ndo occur. We do not believe that any of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position. However, we could incur judgments, enter\ninto settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of matters, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or our\ncash flows in the period in which the amounts are accrued or paid.\n(a)\n(a)\n25\n\n\nPFIZER INC.

For proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party, we have adopted a disclosure\nthreshold of $1 million in potential or actual governmental monetary sanctions.\nThe principal pending matters to which we are a party are discussed below. In determining whether a pending matter is a principal matter, we consider both\nquantitative and qualitative factors to assess materiality, such as, among others, the amount of damages and the nature of other relief sought, if specified; our\nview of the merits of the claims and of the strength of our defenses; whether the action purports to be, or is, a class action and, if not certified, our view of the\nlikelihood that a class will be certified by the court; the jurisdiction in which the proceeding is pending; whether related actions have been transferred to\nmultidistrict litigation; any experience that we or, to our knowledge, other companies have had in similar proceedings; whether disclosure of the action would\nbe important to a reader of our financial statements, including whether disclosure might change a reader’s judgment about our financial statements in light of\nall of the information that is available to the reader; the potential impact of the proceeding on our reputation; and the extent of public interest in the matter.

Also, counterclaims, as well as various independent actions, have been filed alleging\nthat our assertions of, or attempts to enforce, patent rights with respect to certain products constitute unfair competition and/or violations of antitrust laws.

Some of our collaboration or licensing partners face challenges to the validity of their patent rights in non-\nU.S. jurisdictions. For example, in April 2022, the U.K. High Court issued a judgment finding invalid a BMS patent related to Eliquis due to expire in 2026. In\nNovember 2022, BMS received permission to appeal the High Court’s decision and the appeal hearing was held in April 2023. In May 2023, the Court of\nAppeal dismissed the appeal. Additional challenges are pending in other jurisdictions. Also, in July 2022, CureVac AG (CureVac) brought a patent infringement\naction against BioNTech and certain of its subsidiaries in the German Regional Court alleging that Comirnaty infringes certain German utility model patents\nand certain expired and unexpired European patents. Additional challenges involving Comirnaty patents may be filed against us and/or BioNTech in other\njurisdictions in the future. Adverse decisions in these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We are also party to patent\ndamages suits in various jurisdictions pursuant to which generic drug manufacturers, payers, governments or other parties are seeking damages from us for\nallegedly causing delay of generic entry.\nWe also are often involved in other proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, as well as court proceedings relating to our intellectual property or the\nintellectual property rights of others, including challenges to such rights initiated by us. For example, we have challenged certain of GSK’s RSV vaccine\npatents in certain ex-U.S. jurisdictions. Also, if one of our patents (or one of our collaboration/licensing partner’s patents) is found to be invalid by such\nproceedings, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several\nof the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio have been challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. Patent and\nTrademark Office, as well as outside the U.S. The invalidation of any of the patents in our pneumococcal portfolio could potentially allow additional\ncompetitor vaccines, if approved, to enter the marketplace earlier than anticipated. In the event that any of the patents are found valid and infringed, a\ncompetitor’s vaccine, if approved, might be prohibited from entering the market or a competitor might be required to pay us a royalty.\nWe are also subject to patent litigation pursuant to which one or more third parties seek damages and/or injunctive relief to compensate for alleged\ninfringement of its patents by our commercial or other activi",

Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility\nfor its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that\nare responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions.

Of this amount, current contract terms provide for\nexpected delivery of product with contracted revenue from 2023 through 2026, the timing and terms of which may be renegotiated. Remaining performance\nobligations are based on foreign exchange rates as of the end of our fiscal second quarter of 2023 and exclude arrangements with an original expected contract\nduration of less than one year.\nDeferred Revenues––Our deferred revenues primarily relate to advance payments received or receivable from various government or government sponsored\ncustomers in international markets for supply of Comirnaty. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty total $1.2 billion as of July 2, 2023, with $1.2 billion\nand $28 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The deferred revenues related to Comirnaty totaled $2.5 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2022, with $2.4 billion and $77 million recorded in current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities, respectively. The decrease in Comirnaty deferred\nrevenues during the first six months of 2023 was primarily the result of amounts recognized in Revenues as we delivered the products to our customers,\npartially offset by additional advance payments received as we entered into amended contracts and the impact of foreign exchange. During the second quarter\nand first six months of 2023, we recognized revenue of approximately $300 million and $2.0 billion, respectively, that was included in the balance of\nComirnaty deferred revenues as of December 31, 2022. The Comirnaty deferred revenues as of July 2, 2023 will be recognized in Revenues proportionately as\nwe transfer control of the product to our customers and satisfy our performance obligation under the contracts, with the amounts included in current liabilities\nexpected to be recognized in Revenues within the next 12 months, and the amounts included in noncurrent liabilities expected to be recognized in Revenues in\n2024.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\nOPERATIONS\nGENERAL\nThe following MD&A is intended to assist the reader in understanding our financial condition and results of operations, including an evaluation of the amounts\nand certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources, and is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the condensed\nconsolidated financial statements and related notes in Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q.\nReferences to operational variances pertain to period-over-period changes that exclude the impact of foreign exchange rates. Although foreign exchange rate\nchanges are part of our business, they are not within our control and because they can mask positive or negative trends in the business, we believe presenting\noperational variances excluding these foreign exchange changes provides useful information to evaluate our results.\nOVERVIEW OF OUR PERFORMANCE, OPERATING ENVIRONMENT, STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK\nOur Business and Strategy––Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies\nto people that extend and significantly improve their lives. In 2023, we are making additional investments in both R&D and SI&A to support Pfizer’s near- and\nlonger-term growth plans, including to support anticipated new launches, commercial launch of COVID-19 products, potential pipeline programs and recently\nacquired assets. We manage our commercial operations through a global structure consisting of two operating segments: Biopharma and Business Innovation.\nBiopharma is the only reportable segment. See Note 13A.\nWe expect to incur costs of approximately $700 million in connection with separating Upjohn, of which approximately 90% has been incurred since inception\nand through the second quarter of 2023. These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end\nR&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated\nwhile increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this\nprogram, see the Costs and Expenses––Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives\nsection within MD&A.\nIn July 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing\nhow our R&D operations are conducted.

Business section and Overview of Our Performance,\nOperating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOur Business Development Initiatives––We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product\npipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business\ndevelopment activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio––In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of\nAstraZeneca plc, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent\nwith our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can\nhave a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of\nup to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to\ncustomary closing conditions.\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)––In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative\nmedicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset\nprograms by leveraging Flagship’s ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an\noption to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and\nroyalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n38\n\n\nTermination of Collaboration Arrangement with Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (Merck KGaA)––In March 2023, it was announced that our alliance with\nMerck KGaA to co-develop and co-commercialize Bavencio (avelumab) will terminate. Effective June 30, 2023, Merck KGaA took full control of the global\ncommercialization of Bavencio. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the current profit share will be replaced by a 15% royalty to Pfizer on net sales of\nBavencio. We and Me",

The operational decrease was\nprimarily driven by declines in Paxlovid and Comirnaty. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $537 million, or 5%,\noperationally, reflecting revenues from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, and strong growth from the Vyndaqel family, partially\noffset by declines in Inflectra in the U.S. and Ibrance.\nRevenues decreased $22.4 billion, or 42%, in the first six months of 2023 to $31.0 billion from $53.4 billion in the first six months of 2022, reflecting an\noperational decrease of $21.4 billion, or 40%, as well as an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.0 billion, or 2%. The operational decrease was\nprimarily driven by declines in Comirnaty and Paxlovid. Excluding contributions from Comirnaty and Paxlovid, revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 5%,\noperationally, reflecting revenues from recently acquired products, Nurtec ODT/Vydura and Oxbryta, as well as strong growth from the Vyndaqel family and\nEliquis, and increased Sulperazon revenues in China in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by a decline in Ibrance.\nAs of August 1, 2023, on a total company basis, we forecasted revenues in 2023 of $67 billion to $70 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 31% at the\nmidpoint from 2022 results, which we expect will also have an unfavorable impact on Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes\non income. The total company expected revenue declines in 2023 are driven by an expected reduction in sales of our COVID-19 products, partially offset by\nexpected operational growth from our non-COVID-19 in-line portfolio, anticipated new product and indication launches, and recently acquired products.\nSee the Revenues by Geography and Revenues––Selected Product Discussion sections for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our\nrevenue performance.

Certain of our products have\nexperienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased\ngeneric competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent\nexpiries from 2023 through 2025. We anticipate a more significant impact of reduced revenues from patent expiries in 2026 through 2030 as several of our in-\nline products experience patent-based expirations. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against\n39\n\n\ninfringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure\nappropriate patient access.\nFor additional information, see the Item 1.

We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing and access pressures\nglobally.

The HiRise warehouse sustained major damage\nand all raw materials, packaging supplies and finished medicines stored within were damaged. All necessary supplies have been reordered for expedited\ndelivery and we are actively engaging with suppliers. We are working diligently to move product stored within other areas of the facility not impacted by the\nevent to other nearby sites for storage and to secure temporary warehouse space in the vicinity, as an interim solution, until the warehouse on the Rocky Mount\ncampus can be rebuilt. We are also exploring alternative manufacturing locations for production across our significant manufacturing presence in the U.S. and\ninternationally and across our partner network.

In response to requests from various regulatory authorities, manufacturers across the pharmaceutical industry, including Pfizer, are evaluating their\nproduct portfolios for the potential presence or formation of nitrosamines. This has led to recalls, including our voluntary recall of Chantix in 2021 and\nadditional voluntary recalls initiated for other products in 2022 due to the presence of nitrosamines above the FDA interim acceptable intake limit, and may\nlead to additional recalls or other market actions for Pfizer products.\nExcept for the recent tornado in Rocky Mount, NC discussed above, we have not seen a significant disruption of our supply chain in the first six months of\n2023 and to date, and all of our manufacturing sites globally have continued to operate at or near normal levels; however, we continue to see heightened\ndemand in the industry for certain components and raw materials, which could potentially result in constraining available supply leading to a possible future\nimpact on our business.

We are also evaluating Paxlovid for additional populations. See the\nProduct Developments section within MD&A.\nIn the first six months of 2023 and to date, we principally sold Comirnaty globally under government contracts and Paxlovid globally to government agencies\nand distributors. We expect Comirnaty in the U.S. will transition to traditional commercial market sales in the second half of 2023, triggered by the expiration\nof current contracts and the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and BioNTech purchased through them becoming either depleted or not used following the\nintroduction of a new variant vaccine. Internationally, we expect sales of Comirnaty in international developed markets to generally be under government\ncontracts in 2023, and in emerging markets, under a combination of private channels and government contracts; in both cases, we expect to generally transition\nto commercial markets starting in 2024. For Paxlovid, we expect to transition to traditional commercial markets in the second half of 2023 rather than\nsignificant government purchases. We anticipate this transition in the U.S. to occur in the second half of 2023, though at this point we have not yet agreed on a\ntransition plan with the U.S. government. We also remain committed to helping ensure broad and equitable access to our COVID-19 products to eligible\npatients around the world. Revenues from our COVID-19 products are expected to go from their peak in 2022 to their low point in 2023 before potentially\nreturning to growth in 2024. While patient demand for our COVID-19 products is expected to remain strong throughout 2023, much of that demand is expected\nto be fulfilled by existing supply of products that were delivered to governments and recorded as revenues in 2022. As of August 1, 2023, we forecasted\nComirnaty revenues of approximately $13.5 billion in 2023, down 64% from actual 2022 results, with gross profit to be split evenly with BioNTech, and\nPaxlovid revenues of approximately $8 billion in 2023, down 58% from actual 2022 results. These forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions that are\nsubject to significant uncertainties, including, among others, patient demand, which could be significantly impacted by the infectiousness and severity of the\npredominant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus during 2023, proportion of the population that receives a vaccine or is treated with an oral antiviral treatment, the\nnumber of doses per vaccinated person per year, number of symptomatic infections, market share of Comirnaty and Paxlovid and the timing for transitioning\nComirnaty and Paxlovid to commercial markets in the U.S.\nFor information on the impact of COVID-19 on our business, operations and financial conditions and results and risks associated with COVID-19 and our\nCOVID-19 products, as well as COVID-19 intellectual property disputes",

These deductions represent estimates of the related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when\nestimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, adjustments to these estimates to reflect actual results or\nupdated expectations, have not been material to our overall business and generally have been less than 1% of revenues.

In the\nU.S., the original monovalent Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is no longer authorized for emergency use or CDC-recommended, although Comirnaty\nremains a licensed vaccine. This decision relates entirely to the FDA’s strategy to harmonize COVID-19 vaccines and is not indicative of any safety-related\nsignals or concerns.\n47\n\n\nIn February 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the submission of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDA for approval of the\ncompanies’ Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent (Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5)) as\na primary series and booster dose(s) for individuals 12 years of age and older.\nIn June 2023, Pfizer and BioNTech announced the companies have submitted a regulatory application to the FDA for their Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted\nmono",

Additionally, the payout for performance share awards is determined in part by Adjusted net income, which is derived from Adjusted income. Beginning in the first quarter\nof 2022, we no longer exclude any expenses for acquired IPR&D from our non-GAAP Adjusted results but we continue to exclude certain of these expenses for our financial results for annual\nincentive compensation purposes. The bonus pool funding, which is largely based on financial performance, is adjusted by our R&D pipeline performance, as measured by four metrics, and\nperformance against certain of our ESG metrics, and may be further modified by our Compensation Committee’s assessment of other factors.\nAdjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and,\ntherefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar\nmeasures of other companies and are presented to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance. A limitation of these\nmeasures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance\nto peers. These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their most directly comparable GAAP measures of Net income attributable to\nPfizer Inc. common shareholders, components of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common\nshareholders—diluted, respectively.\nWe also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, these measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process\nsolely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity\ntargets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded\npharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plans.\nAdjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nAmortization of Intangible Assets—Adjusted income excludes all amortization of in",

We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies. Acquisition-related items may include\npurchase accounting impacts such as the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation\nrelated to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value\nchanges for contingent consideration.\nDiscontinued Operations—Adjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such\noperations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we\ndo not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation\nor change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\n(a) \n(b)\n(a)\n(a)\n(a)\n(b)\n52\n\n\nCertain Significant Items—Adjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on\na quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably\npossible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal\nwith a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic\nconditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the\nresult of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal matters related to divested\nproducts or businesses. Gains and losses on equity securities, and pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses have a very high degree\nof inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and\nlosses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business.

Any failure to consummate the acquisition in the anticipated timeframe or at all could prevent Pfizer from receiving the\nexpected benefits from the acquisition. See the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—Our Business Development\nInitiatives and the Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results sections within MD&A.\nWe have expended and will continue to expend significant time and resources in connection with the acquisition of Seagen and have incurred\nsubstantial indebtedness to fund the acquisition.\nPfizer has expended and will continue to expend significant management time and resources and expenses related to the acquisition of Seagen, many of which\nmust be paid regardless of whether the acquisition is consummated. For example, such time, resources and expenses will be incurred in connection with\nseeking regulatory approvals for the transaction. We intend to finance a portion of the transaction with the proceeds from the $31 billion of long-term debt\nissued in May 2023, plus additional short-term indebtedness to be issued prior to the acquisition, which indebtedness may limit our operating or financial\nflexibility relative to our current position.\nWe may not be successful in identifying and executing potential business development transactions, such as our acquisition of Seagen, or realizing the\nfinancial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of any historical or potential business development transaction, which could have an\nadverse impact on our ability to meet our growth objectives.\nWe have established significant growth goals, which we plan to achieve, in part, by accelerating revenue growth by not only advancing our own product\npipelines and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various forms of business development activities, which can include alliances,\nlicenses, JVs, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, divestments, mergers and acquisitions. Our proposed acquisition of Seagen is part\nof that accelerated revenue growth plan. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing\nopportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Upjohn Business Spin-off:** Mentioned in multiple chunks (2 and 40) as having been spun off to create Viatris, but this occurred in 2020, not relevant to Q2'2023.\n   - **Discontinued Operations:** Chunk 6 mentions discontinued operations in 2023, but lacks specific details to confirm a spin-off.\n   - **Haleon Spin-off:** Chunks 11 and 17 mention the demerger of GSK's Consumer Healthcare JV to form Haleon in 2022, which is not directly related to Pfizer.\n   - **Wyeth Holdings LLC:** Chunk 39 refers to a spin-off or divestiture from 2009, which is not relevant to the current question.\n   - **Proposed Divestiture to Alexion:** Chunk 50 mentions a proposed divestiture in July 2023, which is after Q2'2023.\n   - **Bavencio and Merck KGaA:** Chunk 51 mentions a change in R&D control, but not a spin-off.\n   - **Acquisition of Biohaven:** Chunk 60 mentions an acquisition, not a spin-off.\n   - **Proposed Acquisition Impact:** Chunk 80 mentions potential future business combinations or disposals, but not specific to Q2'2023.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - The information is not sufficient to confirm a spin-off of a large business segment by Pfizer as of Q2'2023. Most mentions are either historical, related to other companies, or lack specific details about a spin-off occurring in the relevant timeframe.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - Specific details or announcements from Pfizer regarding any spin-offs or divestitures planned or executed in Q2'2023.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Based on the gathered information, there is no evidence of Pfizer spinning off any large business segments as of Q2'2023. The mentions of spin-offs are either historical or pertain to other companies, and the proposed divestiture to Alexion is after the relevant period.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - There are no direct conflicts in the gathered information, as none of the chunks provide evidence of a spin-off by Pfizer in Q2'2023. The citations support this conclusion by indicating the timing and nature of the mentioned activities."
