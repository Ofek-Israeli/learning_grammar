Total length: 488780 characters.: \n\n## Question\nAs of FY 2021, how much did Verizon expect to pay for its retirees in 2024?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 488780 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about Verizon's expected payments for its retirees in 2024, focus on the sections of the financial document that discuss future obligations and projections related to retiree benefits. Look for information in the notes to the financial statements, particularly those related to pension plans and other post-employment benefits. Pay attention to any tables or narratives that outline projected benefit obligations or expected cash flows for future years, specifically highlighting the year 2024. Additionally, review any management discussion and analysis (MD&A) sections that might provide insights into the company's strategic planning and financial expectations for retiree-related expenses."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

We expect to meet the demand for 4G and 5G spectrum needs with \nour existing spectrum assets. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of technology, we can \nmeet that demand by acquiring licenses or leasing spectrum from other licensees, or by acquiring new spectrum licenses from the FCC, if and \nwhen future FCC spectrum auctions occur. \nFrom time to time we have exchanged spectrum licenses with other wireless service providers through secondary market swap transactions. \nWe expect to continue to pursue similar opportunities to trade spectrum licenses in order to meet capacity and expansion needs in the future. \nIn certain cases, we have entered into intra-market spectrum swaps designed to increase the amount of contiguous spectrum within frequency \nbands in a specific market. Contiguous spectrum improves network performance and efficiency. These swaps, as well as any spectrum \npurchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals. \nInformation regarding spectrum license transactions is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon \nCommunications Inc. and Subsidiaries. \nHuman Capital Resources1 \nAt Verizon, we know that our people are one of our most valuable assets.

Other \nVerizon services are subject to state and local regulation. \nFederal, State and Local Regulation \nWireless Services \nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition \nand transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and \ndistribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of \ntechnology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a \ncompetitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential \nconditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including \nboth voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the \nFCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not \nrenewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to \ncomply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use \ndevices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on \nwireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 \nservices, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. \nThe Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does \nnot prohibit states from regulating the other \"terms and conditions\" of wireless service. For example, some states impose reporting \nrequirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation \nmatters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing \napprovals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.\n11\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nBroadband \nVerizon offers many different broadband services.

Additionally, a number of states have taken steps to attempt to regulate broadband and two of \nthose cases related to regulations in California and Vermont are being litigated in the courts.

For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier \nservices are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC \nhas not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 \ncapabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. \nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. \nVerizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject \nto various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more \nlightly regulated. \nVideo \nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable \noperators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, \nVerizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply \nwith certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. \nPrivacy and Data Security \nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our \nbusiness, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the artificial intelligence \nand IoT space.

These regulations \ncould have a significant impact on our businesses. \nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity \nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread \navailability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could \noccur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The \nFCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national \nsecurity risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent \nnatural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters; for example, \nthe California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations on back-up power for communications facilities. \nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access \nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over \ndifferent networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and \nconditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these \nservices, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms \nand conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. \nRegulatory Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \nSince the time that COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020, Verizon has been subject to various international, federal, state \nand local policies, regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the \nworld’s population. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, \nincluding telecommunications companies, can operate their business and interact with their customers.

It is impossible to predict with any certainty the outcome of pending \nfederal and state regulatory proceedings relating to our operations, or the reviews by federal or state courts of regulatory rulings. Without \nrelief, existing laws and regulations may inhibit our ability to expand our business and introduce new products and services. Similarly, we \ncannot guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining the licenses needed to carry out our business plan or in maintaining our existing \nlicenses.

Network densification enables us to add capacity to address increasing mobile video consumption and the growing demand for IoT \nproducts and services on our 4G LTE and 5G networks. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G wireless \ntechnology industry standards and the ecosystems for fixed and mobile 5G wireless services. We expect that 5G technology will provide \nhigher throughput and lower latency than the current 4G LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of \ninternet-connected devices grows. As of December 31, 2021, 5G Ultra Wideband is available in parts of 87 U.S. cities and 5G Home is \navailable in parts of 65 U.S. cities. 5G Nationwide uses low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, which \nallows 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s \nhigh-band Ultra Wideband coverage area, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G ",

Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and \nassumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units. \nWireless Licenses \nThe carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $147.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. We aggregate our wireless licenses \ninto one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our \nwireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. \nThere are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. \nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to \nfirst perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect \nto bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to \nperform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative \nimpairment assessment according to the policy. \nOur quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated \ncarrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the \nGreenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash \nflow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A \ndiscounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless \nlicenses as of the valuation date.

The terminal value growth rate represented \nour estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate. \nThe quantitative impairment assessment we performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses \nis substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value \nof our wireless licenses, the fair value would have still exceeded their carrying value. We do not believe reasonable changes in significant \nestimates would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis \npoints (bps) or if the WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair value of wireless licenses would still exceed its carrying value. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is \nmore likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered \nseveral qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including \nchanges in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, \nprojections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a \nwhole, as well as other factors.

The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash \nflow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-projected cash flows and a terminal value. \nThe terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete \nprojection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete \nperiod and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital \n(WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill \nimpairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on \ndiscount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA \ngrowth relative to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in \nthe selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and \nprofitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in \none or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future. \nA projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may \nresult in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) more than anticipated increase in promotional \nactivity, decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to \nachieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives.

We maintained \nallowances for uncollectible accounts receivable, including our direct-channel device payment plan agreement receivables, for estimated \nlosses resulting from the failure or inability of our customers to make required payments. Indirect-channel device payment receivables are \nconsidered financial instruments and were initially recorded at fair value net of imputed interest, and credit losses were recorded as incurred. \nHowever, receivable balances were assessed quarterly for impairment and an allowance was recorded if the receivable was considered \nimpaired.

The impact of these factors on the allowance involves significant level of \nestimation and is subject to uncertainty. Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets \npooled together with similar risk characteristics. \nWe record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible. For device payment plan agreement \nreceivables, we record bad debt expense based on a default and loss calculation using our proprietary loss model. The expected loss rate is \ndetermined based on customer credit scores and other qualitative factors as noted above. The loss rate is assigned individually on a customer \nby customer basis and the custom credit scores are then aggregated by vintage and used in our proprietary loss model to calculate the \nweighted-average loss rate used for determining the allowance balance. The weighted-average expected loss rate decreased 0.81% at \nDecember 31, 2021 as compared to at December 31, 2020. We expect that an increase or decrease of 0.25% in the weighted-average loss rate \nwould result in a change of $94 million in the allowance. \nWe monitor the collectability of our wireless service receivables as one overall pool. Wireline service receivables are disaggregated and \npooled by the following customer groups: consumer, small and medium business, global enterprise, public sector and wholesale. For wireless \nservice receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month \nrolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over \nthe contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s \nqualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on \nhistorical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as \ndiscussed above. \nIf there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those \ncurrently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are \nmade.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’s financial \nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect \nto Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits \nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and \nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis \nfor our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit \nmatter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the \ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n49\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nValuation of Employee Benefit Obligations \nDescription of the Matter The Company sponsors several pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans.

As \nexplained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to \nmeasure employee benefit obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to \nreflect the actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. \nAuditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial \nassumptions (e.g., discount rate, health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and mortality rates) used in \nthe measurement process. These assumptions had a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation. \nHow We Addressed the \nMatter in Our Audit \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the \nemployee benefits obligation valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of \nthe employee benefit obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided \nto the actuary. \nTo test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the \nmethodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the \nCompany. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends, current economic \nfactors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year due to the change in service \ncost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we \ninvolved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount \nrate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit \nobligations. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and \ncompared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost \ntrends, per capita claims cost trends and the mortality rates, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in \nevaluating the assumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available \ninformation, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied. We also tested \nthe completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to management’s \nactuarial specialists. \n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP \nErnst & Young LLP \nWe have served as Verizon's auditor since 2000. \nNew York, New York \nFebruary 11, 2022\n50\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Income \nVerizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries \n(dollars in mil",

The consolidated financial \nstatements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. \nFor controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity. Investments \nin businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted \nfor using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance \nsheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. \nBasis of Presentation \nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. \nUse of Estimates \nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and \nforward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from COVID-19 \npandemic and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission. As the extent and duration of the impacts \nfrom COVID-19 remain unclear, the Company’s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ \nsignificantly from those estimates. \nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and \nequipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, including those related \nto financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, \npension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in \nconnection with business combinations. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the \nsale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business \ncustomers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated mana",

For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an \noutput method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our \nperformance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a \ncontract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage \nrepresents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the \noption (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month \nin advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is \nrendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While \nsubstantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not \nfixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs. \nEquipment \nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the \nproducts are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of \nequipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a \nservice contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. \nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering \ninto a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). \nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid \nby the customer, typically over a 24 or 30-month ter",

The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in \nmeasuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows: \nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \nLevel 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities \nLevel 3 — Unobservable pricing inputs in the market \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the \nvaluation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy. \nIncome Taxes \nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the \nvarious jurisdictions in which we operate. \nDeferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. \nDeferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be \nrealized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. \nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is \nrecognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of \nany related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the \nmore-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full \nknowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition \nthreshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements.

Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with \nthe rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our  \nallocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which \nare estimated to be $7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing \ncosts. In January 2022, we made additional payments of $1.4 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives, which were \naccrued as of December 31, 2021 in our consolidated balance sheet.

We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably \ncertain that we will exercise that option. \nDuring March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower \nacquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion.

We continue to include the towers in Property, plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them \naccordingly. In addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, American Tower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases \nrelated to these towers.

Verizon’s experience has been that the payment attributes \nof longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future payments. Customers with longer tenures tend \nto exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and receivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to \nperform better than receivables from customers that have not previously been Verizon customers. As a result of this experience, we make \ninitial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are \"established customers\" or \"short-tenured customers.\" If a Consumer customer \nhas been a customer for 45 days or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an \n\"established customer.\" For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of \ninternal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has been a customer \nfor less than 12 months, the customer is considered a \"short-tenured customer.\" For short-tenured customers, the credit decision and credit \nmonitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources. \nInternal data and/or external credit data are obtained from the credit reporting agencies, if available, to create a custom credit risk score for \nConsumer customers.

The carrying value of \ncash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. \nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the \nlast business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, \ninternational bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-\ncounter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published \nsources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes. \nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). \nCommingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund \nmanagers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. \nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real \nestate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment \nmanager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance \nor appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based upon available and current market \ninformation and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, \nestimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These \ndifferences could be material. \nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last \nbusiness day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified \nby the asset class of the underlying holdings. \nHedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on st",

The preferred shares pay cumulative dividends of 8.25% per annum. \nCommon Stock \nIn February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's \ncommon stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase \nplan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Verizon did \nnot repurchase any shares of Verizon’s common stock under our current or previously authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, \n2021, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million. \nCommon stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the \nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we issued 2.1 million, 2.3 million and 3.8 million common shares from treasury stock, \nrespectively, which had an insignificant aggregate value. \nIn connection with our acquisition of Tracfone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of Verizon common shares \nfrom treasury stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion.

Commitments and Contingencies \nIn the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal \nlevel. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a \ngiven matter, the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of \nthe reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors \ntypical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; \n(3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party \nand its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not\n102\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nexpect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial \ncondition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period. \nVerizon is currently involved in approximately 20 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents.

These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial \nin the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and \nwarranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as \nindemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to \ndefend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business. \nSubsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was \nissued when the directory business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, \nwithout modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon Information Services Canada and the spin-off of our domestic print and internet \nyellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably \nestimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may offset each \nother. We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely. \nAs of December 31, 2021, letters of credit totaling approximately $674 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and \nsupport several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2021, Verizon entered into seven renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 13 signed in \nprevious years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term of \n12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation, which is expected to occur through 2024, as \napplicable. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the \nfacilities. \nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and \nlegally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $29.8 billion, \nand primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items \nwhich will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers.

In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-\nyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core financial \nsystems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information \nreporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.\n103\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, \ncould result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting.

Management has evaluated internal control over financial reporting of the company using the criteria for effective \ninternal control established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission in 2013. \nIn accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their \nfirst assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management's \nassessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), which \nthe Company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the \nCompany's acquisition of Tracfone. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the \ndate of acquisition. Tracfone represented approximately 3% of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2021, and less than 1% of \nconsolidated total revenues for the year then ended. \nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Based on this \nassessment, management believes that the internal control over financial reporting of the company is effective as of December 31, 2021. In \nconnection with this assessment, there were no material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified by \nmanagement. The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has provided an attestation report on the \ncompany’s internal control over financial reporting and is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. \nItem 9B.

If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5.

The outputs do not provide any figures or details about expected retiree payments in 2024.\n3. **Missing Information**: We need specific details on Verizon's expected retiree payments for 2024, such as figures from pension plans or post-employment benefit obligations.\n4. **Next Steps**: We should look for sections in the document that specifically discuss pension plans, retiree benefits, or future financial obligations related to retirees. This might include tables or narrative sections in the financial statements or notes.\n\nIn summary, the current outputs do not provide the necessary information to answer the question about retiree payments in 2024.

We expect customer migration from traditional voice services to wireless \nservices to continue as a growing number of customers place greater value on mobility and wireless companies position their services as a \nlandline alternative. We also face increasing competition from cable operators and other providers of VoIP services as well as internet portal \nproviders. \nWe believe that the following are the most important competitive factors and trends in the telecommunications industry: \n•\nNetwork reliability, speed and coverage. We consider networks that consistently provide high-quality, fast and reliable service to be \na key differentiator in the market and driver of customer satisfaction. Lower prices, improved service quality and new service \nofferings, which in many cases include video content, have led to increased customer usage of connectivity services. We and other \nnetwork-based providers must ensure that our networks can meet these increasing capacity usage requirements and offer highly \nreliable national coverage. \n•\nPricing. With respect to wireless services and equipment, pricing plays an important role in the wireless competitive landscape. As \nthe demand for wireless services continues to grow, wireless service providers are offering a range of service plans at competitive \nprices. Many wireless service providers also bundle wireless service offerings with other content and offer promotional pricing and \nincentives, some of which may be targeted specifically to customers of Verizon. We and other wireless service providers, as well as \nequipment manufacturers, offer device payment options, which provide customers with the ability to pay for their device over a \nperiod of time, and some providers offer device leasing arrangements. In addition, aggressive device promotions have become more \ncommon in an effort to gain a greater share of subscribers interested in changing carriers. Pricing also plays an important role in the \nwireline competitive landscape, as traditional service providers compete aggressively in offerings such as IP Networking, Core \nVoice and other legacy products. In addition, as non-traditional modes of providing wireline communication services emerge, new \nentrants attempt to capture market share from incumbents using competitive pricing. For example, VoIP and portal-based voice and \nvideo calling is often free or nearly free for customers and supported by advertising revenues.\n7\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\n•\nCustomer service.

Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition \nand transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and \ndistribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of \ntechnology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a \ncompetitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential \nconditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including \nboth voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the \nFCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not \nrenewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to \ncomply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use \ndevices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations.

Common carrier \nservices are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC \nhas not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 \ncapabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. \nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. \nVerizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject \nto various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more \nlightly regulated. \nVideo \nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable \noperators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, \nVerizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply \nwith certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. \nPrivacy and Data Security \nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our \nbusiness, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the artificial intelligence \nand IoT space. At the federal level, our business is governed by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending on the product \nor service. Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, \nwhich went into effect in January 2020, both include significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, other states and countries have \ncontinued to adopt new privacy laws that apply to us. Generally, attention to privacy and data security requirements is in",

These regulations \ncould have a significant impact on our businesses. \nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity \nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread \navailability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could \noccur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The \nFCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national \nsecurity risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent \nnatural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters; for example, \nthe California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations on back-up power for communications facilities. \nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access \nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over \ndifferent networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and \nconditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these \nservices, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms \nand conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. \nRegulatory Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \nSince the time that COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020, Verizon has been subject to various international, federal, state \nand local policies, regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the \nworld’s population. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, \nincluding telecommunications companies, can operate their business and interact with their customers. Because the severity, magnitude and \nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing, the impact of the crisis and the \ngovernmental responses to the crisis on our business in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict. \n12\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nInformation About Our Executive Officers \nSee Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this Annual Report on Form 10",

Cyber attacks against companies, including Verizon, have \nincreased in frequency, scope and potential harm in recent years. They may occur alone or in conjunction with physical attacks, especially \nwhere disruption of service is an objective of the attacker. The development and maintenance of systems to prevent such attacks is costly and \nrequires ongoing monitoring and updating to address their increasing prevalence and sophistication. While, to date, we have not been subject \nto cyber attacks that, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to Verizon's operations or financial condition, the preventive actions \nwe take to reduce the risks associated with cyber attacks, including protection of our systems and networks, may be insufficient to repel or \nmitigate the effects of a major cyber attack in the future. \nThe inability to operate or use our networks and systems or those of our suppliers, vendors and other service providers as a result of cyber \nattacks, even for a limited period of time, may result in significant expenses to Verizon and/or a loss of market share to our competitors. The \ncosts associated with a major cyber attack on Verizon could include expensive incentives offered to existing customers and business partners \nto retain their business, increased expenditures on cybersecurity measures and the use of alternate resources, lost revenues from business \ninterruption and litigation. Further, certain of Verizon’s businesses, such as those offering security solutions and infrastructure and cloud \nservices to business customers, could be negatively affected if our ability to protect our own networks and systems is called into question as a \nresult of a cyber attack.

For example, our smartphone and other device suppliers often rely on one vendor for the manufacture and supply of critical \ncomponents, such as chipsets, used in their devices, and there are a limited number of companies capable of supplying the network \ninfrastructure equipment on which we depend. These suppliers or vendors could fail to provide equipment or service on a timely basis, or fail \nto meet our performance expectations, for a number of reasons, including, for example, disruption to the global supply chain as a result of \ngeopolitical factors, the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters or the potential impacts of global climate change. If such failures occur, we \nmay be unable to provide products and services as and when requested by our customers, or we may be unable to continue to maintain or \nupgrade our networks. Because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another, our business \ncould be substantially disrupted if we were required to, or chose to, replace the products or services of one or more major suppliers with \nproducts or services from another source, especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice. Any such disruption could increase \nour costs, decrease our operating efficiencies and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. \nThe suppliers and vendors on which we rely may also be subject to litigation with respect to technology on which we depend, including \nlitigation involving claims of patent infringement. Such claims are frequently made in the communications industry. We are unable to predict \nwhether our business will be affected by any such litigation.

We \nbelieve that this measure is useful to management, investors and other users of our financial information in evaluating the effectiveness of our \noperations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance.

Further, the exclusion of \nnon-operational items and special items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.

Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire \nconsolidated statements of cash flows. \nThe following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow: \n(dollars in millions) \nYears Ended December 31,\n2021\n2020 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$ \n39,539 \n$ \n41,768 \nLess Capital expenditures (including capitalized software)\n20,286 \n18,192 \nFree cash flow\n$ \n19,253 \n$ \n23,576 \nThe decrease in free cash flow during 2021 is a reflection of the decrease in operating cash flows, as well as the increase in capital \nexpenditures discussed above. \nEmployee Benefit Plans Funded Status and Contributions \nEmployer Contributions \nWe operate numerous qualified and nonqualified pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. These plans primarily relate to our \ndomestic business units. We made no discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan in either 2021 or 2020. During 2021 and 2020 \nwe made contributions of $58 million and $57 million to our nonqualified pension plans, respectively. \nThe Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into \nconsideration risk and return. In an effort to reduce the risk of our portfolio strategy and better align assets with liabilities, we have adopted a \nliability driven pension strategy that seeks to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets with the interest rate \nsensitivity of the liability. We expect that the strategy will reduce the likelihood that assets will decline at a time when liabilities increase \n(referred to as liability hedging), with the goal to reduce the risk of underfunding to the plan and its participants and beneficiaries; however, \nwe also expect the strategy to result in lower asset returns.

We aggregate our wireless licenses \ninto one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our \nwireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. \nThere are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. \nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to \nfirst perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect \nto bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to \nperform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative \nimpairment assessment according to the policy. \nOur quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated \ncarrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the \nGreenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash \nflow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A \ndiscounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless \nlicenses as of the valuation date. As a result, we were required to make significant estimates about future cash flows and profitability \nspecifically associated with our wireless licenses, an appropriate discount rate based on the risk associated with those estimated cash flows \n41\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nand assumed terminal value and growth rates. We considered current and expected future economic conditions, current and expected \navailability of wireless network technology and infrastructure and related equipment and the costs thereof as well as other relevant factors in \nestimating future cash flows and profitability.

Accordingly, our discount rate \nincorporated our estimate of the expected return a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date, including the risk \npremium associated with the current and expected economic conditions as of the valuation date. The terminal value growth rate represented \nour estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate. \nThe quantitative impairment assessment we performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses \nis substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value \nof our wireless licenses, the fair value would have still exceeded their carrying value. We do not believe reasonable changes in significant \nestimates would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis \npoints (bps) or if the WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair value of wireless licenses would still exceed its carrying value. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is \nmore likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered \nseveral qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including \nchanges in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, \nprojections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a \nwhole, as well as other factors.

The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash \nflow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-projected cash flows and a terminal value. \nThe terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete \nprojection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete \nperiod and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital \n(WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill \nimpairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on \ndiscount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA \ngrowth relative to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in \nthe selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and \nprofitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in \none or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future. \nA projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may \nresult in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) more than anticipated increase in promotional \nactivity, decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to \nachieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives.

In accordance with the terms of the Tracfone Purchase Agreement, Verizon acquired all of Tracfone's outstanding stock in \nexchange for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, net of cash acquired and working capital and other adjustments, subject to customary \nadjustments, 57,596,544 shares of Verizon common stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion, and up to an additional $650 million in future \ncash contingent consideration related to the achievement of certain performance measures and other commercial arrangements. The fair value \nof the Verizon common stock was determined on the basis of its closing market price on the Acquisition Date. The estimated fair value of the \ncontingent consideration as of the Acquisition Date was approximately $542 million calculated using a probability-weighted discounted cash \nflow model and significant unobservable inputs, thus representing a Level 3 measurement. The contingent consideration payable is based on \nthe achievement of certain revenue and operational targets, measured over a two-year earn out period, as defined in the Tracfone Purchase \nAgreement.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of \nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide \nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally \naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of \nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized \nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any \nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or \nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. \n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP \nErnst & Young LLP \nNew York, New York \nFebruary 11, 2022\n48\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nReporting of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Verizon Communications Inc.: \nOpinion on the Financial Statements \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Verizon Communications Inc. and subsidiaries (Verizon) as of \nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for \neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at \nItem 15(a) (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\").

For example, we tested controls over management’s review of \nthe employee benefit obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided \nto the actuary. \nTo test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the \nmethodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the \nCompany. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends, current economic \nfactors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year due to the change in service \ncost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we \ninvolved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount \nrate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit \nobligations. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and \ncompared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost \ntrends, per capita claims cost trends and the mortality rates, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in \nevaluating the assumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available \ninformation, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied.

Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nDescription of Business \nVerizon Communications Inc. (Verizon or the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries, is one of the world’s \nleading providers of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and \ngovernment entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms \nthat are designed to meet customers’ demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control. \nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Verizon Consumer Group (Consumer) and Verizon \nBusiness Group (Business). \nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. Our wireless services are \nprovided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the United States (U.S.) under the Verizon brand and through wholesale and \nother arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband through our wireless networks. Our wireline services are \nprovided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through \nour Verizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. Our Consumer \nsegment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase wireless network \naccess from us on a wholesale basis. \nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video and conferencing services, \ncorporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver \nvarious Internet of Things (IoT) services and products. We also provide FWA broadband through our wireless networks. We provide these \nproducts and services to businesses, government cus",

The consolidated financial \nstatements include our controlled subsidiaries, as well as variable interest entities (VIE) where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. \nFor controlled subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned, the noncontrolling interests are included in Net income and Total equity. Investments \nin businesses that we do not control, but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted \nfor using the equity method. Equity method investments are included in Investments in unconsolidated businesses in our consolidated balance \nsheets. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. \nBasis of Presentation \nWe have reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation. \nUse of Estimates \nWe prepare our financial statements using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires management to make \nestimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and \nforward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from COVID-19 \npandemic and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission. As the extent and duration of the impacts \nfrom COVID-19 remain unclear, the Company’s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ \nsignificantly from those estimates. \nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and \nequipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, including those related \nto financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, \npension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in \nconnection with business combinations. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the \nsale of wireless equipment. These services include a variety of communication and connectivity services for our Consumer and Business \ncustomers including other carriers that use our facilities to provide services to their customers, as well as professional and integrated mana",

We account for these revenues under Accounting Standards Update (ASU) \n2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" (Topic 606).\n56\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nWe also earn revenues that are not accounted for under Topic 606 from leasing arrangements (such as those for towers and equipment), \ncaptive reinsurance arrangements primarily related to wireless device insurance and the interest on equipment financed under a device \npayment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent.  \nNature of Products and Services \nTelecommunications \nService \nWe offer wireless services through a variety of plans on a postpaid or prepaid basis. For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an \noutput method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our \nperformance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a \ncontract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage \nrepresents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the \noption (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month \nin advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is \nrendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While \nsubstantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not \nfixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs. \nEquipment \nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the \nproducts are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of \nequipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a \nservice contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. \nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering \ninto a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). \nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid \nby the customer, typically over a 24 or 30-month ter",

We may \noffer certain promotions that provide billing credits applied over a specified term, contingent upon the customer maintaining service. The \ncredits are included in the transaction price, which are allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative selling price and are \nrecognized when earned. \nA financing component exists in both our fixed-term plans and device payment plans because the timing of the payment for the device, which \noccurs over the contract term, differs from the satisfaction of the performance obligation, which occurs at contract inception upon transfer of \nthe device to the customer. We periodically assess, at the contract level, the significance of the financing component inherent in our fixed-\nterm and device payment plan receivable based on qualitative and quantitative considerations related to our customer classes. These \nconsiderations include assessing the commercial objective of our plans, the term and duration of financing provided, interest rates prevailing \nin the marketplace, and credit risks of our customer classes, all of which impact our selection of appropriate discount rates. Based on current \nfacts and circumstances, we determined that the financing component in our existing wireless device payments and fixed-term contracts sold \nthrough the direct channel is not significant and therefore is not accounted for separately. See Note 8 for additional information on the interest \non equipment financed on a device payment plan agreement when sold to the customer by an authorized agent in our indirect channel. \nWireless Contracts \nFor our wireless contracts, total contract revenue, which represents the transaction price for wireless service and wireless equipment, is \nallocated between service and equipment revenue based on their estimated standalone selling prices. We estimate the standalone selling price \nof the device or accessory to be its retail price excluding subsidies or conditional purchase discounts. We estimate the standalone selling price \nof wireless service to be the price that we offer to customers on month-to-month contracts that can be cancelled at any time without penalty \n(i.e., when there is no fixed-term for service) or when service is procured without the concurrent purchase of a wireless device. In addition, we \nalso assess whether the service term is impacted by certain legally enforceable rights and obligations in our contract with customers, such as \npenalties that a customer would have to pay to early terminate a fixed-term contract or billing credits that would cease if the month-to-month \nwireless service is canceled. The assessment of these legally enforceable rights and obligations involves judgment and impacts our \ndetermination of the transaction price and related disclosures. \nFrom time to time, we may offer certain promotions that provide our customers on device pa",

A \ndiscounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless \nlicenses as of the valuation date.

Verizon’s experience has been that the payment attributes \nof longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future payments. Customers with longer tenures tend \nto exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and receivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to \nperform better than receivables from customers that have not previously been Verizon customers. As a result of this experience, we make \ninitial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are \"established customers\" or \"short-tenured customers.\" If a Consumer customer \nhas been a customer for 45 days or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an \n\"established customer.\" For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of \ninternal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has been a customer \nfor less than 12 months, the customer is considered a \"short-tenured customer.\" For short-tenured customers, the credit decision and credit \nmonitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources. \nInternal data and/or external credit data are obtained from the credit reporting agencies, if available, to create a custom credit risk score for \nConsumer customers.

Stock-Based Compensation \nVerizon Long-Term Incentive Plan \nIn May 2017, Verizon’s shareholders approved the 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) and terminated Verizon's authority to \ngrant new awards under the Verizon 2009 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2009 Plan). The 2017 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants \nto employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted \nstock units, performance shares, performance stock units and other awards. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, Verizon reserved for issuance \nunder the 2017 Plan the number of shares that were remaining but not issued under the 2009 Plan.

As of December 31, \n2021, 76 million shares are reserved for future issuance under the 2017 Plan. \nRestricted Stock Units \nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs) granted under the 2017 Plan generally vest in three equal installments on each anniversary of the grant date. \nThe RSUs that are paid in stock upon vesting and are thus classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon \ncommon stock and are not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The RSUs that are settled in cash are classified as liability awards \nand the liability is measured at its fair value at the end of each reporting period. All RSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend \nequivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to participants if, and only to the extent the applicable RSU award vests, and is paid at the time \nthe RSU award is paid, and in the same proportion as the RSU award. In 2020, Verizon announced a broad-based program that provides for \nthe annual award of cash-settled RSUs under the 2017 Plan to all full-time and part-time employees who meet eligibility requirements on the \nannual grant date. \nWe estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. \nWe use historical data to estimate forfeitures and recognize that estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated \nforfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. \nPerformance Stock Units \nThe 2017 Plan also provides for grants of Performance Stock Units (PSUs) that generally vest at the end of the third year after the grant. As \ndefined by the 2017 Plan, the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors determines the number of PSUs a participant earns \nbased on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved over the three-year performance cycle. The PSUs that \nare paid in stock upon vesting and are classified as equity awards are measured using the grant date fair value of Verizon common stock and \nare not remeasured at the end of each reporting period. The PSUs that are settled in cash and are classified as liability awards are measured at \nits fair value at the end of each reporting period and, therefore, will fluctuate based on the price of Verizon common stock as well as \nperformance relative to the targets. All PSUs granted under the 2017 Plan have dividend equivalent units (DEUs), which will be paid to \nparticipants if, and only to the extent the applicable PSU award vests, and is paid at the time that PSU award is paid, and in the same \nproportion as the PSU award.

The carrying value of \ncash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. \nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the \nlast business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, \ninternational bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-\ncounter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published \nsources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes. \nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). \nCommingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund \nmanagers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. \nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real \nestate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment \nmanager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance \nor appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based upon available and current market \ninformation and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, \nestimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These \ndifferences could be material. \nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last \nbusiness day of the year. Both exchange rates and market prices are readily available from published sources. These securities are classified \nby the asset class of the underlying holdings. \nHedge funds are valued by the custodian at NAV based on st",

The preferred shares pay cumulative dividends of 8.25% per annum. \nCommon Stock \nIn February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's \ncommon stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase \nplan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Verizon did \nnot repurchase any shares of Verizon’s common stock under our current or previously authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, \n2021, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million. \nCommon stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the \nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we issued 2.1 million, 2.3 million and 3.8 million common shares from treasury stock, \nrespectively, which had an insignificant aggregate value. \nIn connection with our acquisition of Tracfone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of Verizon common shares \nfrom treasury stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion.

Commitments and Contingencies \nIn the ordinary course of business, Verizon is involved in various commercial litigation and regulatory proceedings at the state and federal \nlevel. Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a \ngiven matter, the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of \nthe reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors \ntypical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; \n(3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party \nand its demands. We continuously monitor these proceedings as they develop and adjust any accrual or disclosure as needed. We do not\n102\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nexpect that the ultimate resolution of any pending regulatory or legal matter in future periods will have a material effect on our financial \ncondition, but it could have a material effect on our results of operations for a given reporting period. \nVerizon is currently involved in approximately 20 federal district court actions alleging that Verizon is infringing various patents.

These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial \nin the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and \nwarranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as \nindemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to \ndefend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business. \nSubsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was \nissued when the directory business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, \nwithout modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon Information Services Canada and the spin-off of our domestic print and internet \nyellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably \nestimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may offset each \nother. We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely. \nAs of December 31, 2021, letters of credit totaling approximately $674 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and \nsupport several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2021, Verizon entered into seven renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 13 signed in \nprevious years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term of \n12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation, which is expected to occur through 2024, as \napplicable. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the \nfacilities. \nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and \nlegally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $29.8 billion, \nand primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items \nwhich will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers.

In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-\nyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core financial \nsystems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information \nreporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.\n103\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, \ncould result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting.

Management has evaluated internal control over financial reporting of the company using the criteria for effective \ninternal control established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission in 2013. \nIn accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their \nfirst assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management's \nassessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), which \nthe Company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the \nCompany's acquisition of Tracfone. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the \ndate of acquisition. Tracfone represented approximately 3% of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2021, and less than 1% of \nconsolidated total revenues for the year then ended. \nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Based on this \nassessment, management believes that the internal control over financial reporting of the company is effective as of December 31, 2021. In \nconnection with this assessment, there were no material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified by \nmanagement.

The only information extracted relates to payments associated with clearing costs and incentive payment obligations, which are unrelated to retiree payments. \n\n1. **Information Gathered**: The outputs primarily mention payments related to clearing costs through 2024, as per an FCC order, but do not provide any details on retiree payments.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**: The information gathered is insufficient to answer the question about Verizon's expected retiree payments for 2024. The outputs do not contain any specific data or projections related to retiree obligations.\n\n3. **Missing Information**: We need specific details on Verizon's projected retiree payments for 2024. This would typically be found in sections of the financial document discussing pension plans, post-employment benefits, or future financial obligations related to retirees.\n\n4. **Next Steps**: To find the missing information, we should focus on sections of the document that detail pension liabilities, retiree benefit plans, or any financial forecasts related to retiree payments. If these sections were not included in the initial chunking, they should be identified and analyzed.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**: There are no conflicting answers since no relevant information on retiree payments was found.

These swaps, as well as any spectrum \npurchases, require us to obtain governmental approvals. \nInformation regarding spectrum license transactions is included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of Verizon \nCommunications Inc. and Subsidiaries. \nHuman Capital Resources1 \nAt Verizon, we know that our people are one of our most valuable assets.

Other \nVerizon services are subject to state and local regulation. \nFederal, State and Local Regulation \nWireless Services \nThe FCC regulates several aspects of our wireless operations. Generally, the FCC has jurisdiction over the construction, operation, acquisition \nand transfer of wireless communications systems. All wireless services require use of radio frequency spectrum, the assignment and \ndistribution of which is subject to FCC oversight. If demand continues to increase or if new spectrum is required for a future generation of \ntechnology, we can meet our needs for licensed spectrum by purchasing licenses or leasing spectrum from others, or by participating in a \ncompetitive bidding process to acquire new spectrum from the FCC. Those processes are subject to certain reviews, approvals and potential \nconditions. \nToday, Verizon holds FCC spectrum licenses that allow it to provide a wide range of mobile and fixed communications services, including \nboth voice and data services. FCC spectrum licenses typically have a term of 10 years, at which time they are subject to renewal. While the \nFCC has routinely renewed all of Verizon’s wireless licenses, challenges could be raised in the future. If a wireless license was revoked or not \nrenewed, Verizon would not be permitted to provide services on the spectrum covered by that license. Some of our licenses require us to \ncomply with so-called \"open access\" FCC regulations, which generally require licensees of particular spectrum to allow customers to use \ndevices and applications of their choice, subject to certain technical limitations. The FCC has also imposed certain specific mandates on \nwireless carriers, including construction and geographic coverage requirements, technical operating standards, provision of enhanced 911 \nservices, roaming obligations and requirements for wireless tower and antenna facilities. \nThe Act generally preempts regulation by state and local governments of the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers. The Act does \nnot prohibit states from regulating the other \"terms and conditions\" of wireless service. For example, some states impose reporting \nrequirements. Several states also have laws or regulations that address safety issues (e.g., use of wireless handsets while driving) and taxation \nmatters. In addition, wireless tower and antenna facilities are often subject to state and local zoning and land use regulation, and securing \napprovals for new or modified facilities is often a lengthy and expensive process.\n11\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nBroadband \nVerizon offers many different broadband services.

Additionally, a number of states have taken steps to attempt to regulate broadband and two of \nthose cases related to regulations in California and Vermont are being litigated in the courts. Regardless of regulation, Verizon remains \ncommitted to the open internet, which provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content. \nOur commitment to our customers can be found on our website at https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/verizon-broadband-\ncommitment. \nWireline Voice \nVerizon offers many different wireline voice services, including traditional telephone service and other services that rely on technologies such \nas VoIP. For regulatory purposes, legacy telephone services are generally considered to be \"common carrier\" services. Common carrier \nservices are subject to heightened regulatory oversight with respect to rates, terms and conditions and other aspects of the services. The FCC \nhas not decided the regulatory classification of VoIP but has said VoIP service providers must comply with certain rules, such as 911 \ncapabilities and law enforcement assistance requirements. \nState public utility commissions regulate Verizon’s telephone operations with respect to certain telecommunications intrastate matters. \nVerizon operates as an \"incumbent local exchange carrier\" in nine states and the District of Columbia. These incumbent operations are subject \nto various levels of pricing flexibility and other state oversight and requirements. Verizon also has other wireline operations that are more \nlightly regulated. \nVideo \nVerizon offers a multichannel video service that is regulated like traditional cable service. The FCC has a body of rules that apply to cable \noperators, and these rules also generally apply to Verizon. In areas where Verizon offers its facilities-based multichannel video services, \nVerizon has been required to obtain a cable franchise from local government entities, or in some cases a state-wide franchise, and comply \nwith certain one-time and ongoing obligations as a result. \nPrivacy and Data Security \nWe are subject to local, state, federal, and international laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security that impact all parts of our \nbusiness, including wireline, wireless, broadband and the development and roll out of new products, such as those in the artificial intelligence \nand IoT space.

These regulations \ncould have a significant impact on our businesses. \nPublic Safety and Cybersecurity \nThe FCC plays a role in addressing public safety concerns by regulating emergency communications services and mandating widespread \navailability of both media (broadcast/cable) and wireless emergency alerting services. In response to cyber attacks that have occurred or could \noccur in the future, however, the FCC or other regulators may attempt to increase regulation of the cybersecurity practices of providers. The \nFCC is also addressing the use by American companies of equipment produced by certain companies deemed to cause potential national \nsecurity risks. Verizon does not currently use equipment in its networks from vendors under such restrictions. In addition, due to recent \nnatural disasters, federal and state agencies may attempt to impose regulations to ensure continuity of service during disasters; for example, \nthe California Public Utilities Commission has imposed regulations on back-up power for communications facilities. \nIntercarrier Compensation and Network Access \nThe FCC regulates some of the rates that carriers pay each other for the exchange of voice traffic (particularly traditional wireline traffic) over \ndifferent networks and other aspects of interconnection for some voice services. The FCC also regulates some of the rates and terms and \nconditions for certain wireline \"business data services\" and other services and network facilities. Verizon is both a seller and a buyer of these \nservices, and both makes and receives interconnection payments. The FCC has focused in recent years on whether changes in the rates, terms \nand conditions for both the exchange of traffic and for business data services may be appropriate. \nRegulatory Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic \nSince the time that COVID-19 began to spread throughout the world in 2020, Verizon has been subject to various international, federal, state \nand local policies, regulations and initiatives aimed at reducing the transmission of the disease and protecting the health and safety of the \nworld’s population. In addition, governments have imposed a wide variety of consumer protection measures that limit how certain businesses, \nincluding telecommunications companies, can operate their business and interact with their customers. Because the severity, magnitude and \nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain and rapidly changing, the impact of the crisis and the \ngovernmental responses to the crisis on our business in 2022 and beyond remains uncertain and difficult to predict. \n12\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nInformation About Our Executive Officers \nSee Part III, Item 10. \"Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\" of this Annual Report on Form 10",

We expect that 5G technology will provide \nhigher throughput and lower latency than the current 4G LTE technology and enable our networks to handle more traffic as the number of \ninternet-connected devices grows. As of December 31, 2021, 5G Ultra Wideband is available in parts of 87 U.S. cities and 5G Home is \navailable in parts of 65 U.S. cities. 5G Nationwide uses low and mid-band spectrum and dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) technology, which \nallows 5G service to run simultaneously with 4G LTE on multiple spectrum bands. With DSS, whenever customers move outside Verizon’s \nhigh-band Ultra Wideband coverage area, their 5G-enabled devices will remain on 5G ",

Significant and adverse changes to any one or more of the above-noted estimates and \nassumptions could result in an impairment to our wireless licenses and goodwill impairment for one or more of our reporting units. \nWireless Licenses \nThe carrying value of our wireless licenses was approximately $147.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. We aggregate our wireless licenses \ninto one single unit of accounting, as we utilize our wireless licenses on an integrated basis as part of our nationwide wireless network. Our \nwireless licenses provide us with the exclusive right to utilize certain radio frequency spectrum to provide wireless communication services. \nThere are currently no legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors that limit the useful life of our wireless licenses. \nWe test our wireless licenses for potential impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We have the option to \nfirst perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. However, we may elect \nto bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test. It is our policy to \nperform quantitative impairment assessment at least every three years. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we performed a quantitative \nimpairment assessment according to the policy. \nOur quantitative impairment assessment consisted of comparing the estimated fair value of our aggregate wireless licenses to the aggregated \ncarrying amount as of the test date. Under our quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of our wireless licenses using the \nGreenfield approach. The Greenfield approach is an income based valuation approach that values the wireless licenses by calculating the cash \nflow generating potential of a hypothetical start-up company that goes into business with no assets except the wireless licenses to be valued. A \ndiscounted cash flow analysis is used to estimate what a marketplace participant would be willing to pay to purchase the aggregated wireless \nlicenses as of the valuation date.

The terminal value growth rate represented \nour estimate of the marketplace’s long-term growth rate. \nThe quantitative impairment assessment we performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated that the fair value of our wireless licenses \nis substantially in excess of their carrying value and, therefore, did not result in an impairment. In the event of a 10% decline in the fair value \nof our wireless licenses, the fair value would have still exceeded their carrying value. We do not believe reasonable changes in significant \nestimates would change the outcome to this quantitative assessment. For instance, if either the terminal value growth rate declined by 50 basis \npoints (bps) or if the WACC increased by 50 bps, the fair value of wireless licenses would still exceed its carrying value. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we performed a qualitative impairment assessment as our annual impairment test to determine whether it is \nmore likely than not that the fair value of our wireless licenses was less than the carrying amount. As part of our assessment we considered \nseveral qualitative factors including the business enterprise value of our combined wireless business, macroeconomic conditions (including \nchanges in interest rates and discount rates), industry and market considerations (including industry revenue and EBITDA margin results, \nprojections and recent merger and acquisition activity), the recent and projected financial performance of our combined wireless business as a \nwhole, as well as other factors.

The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate discounted cash \nflow results. The discounted cash flow method is based on the present value of two components-projected cash flows and a terminal value. \nThe terminal value represents the expected normalized future cash flows of the reporting unit beyond the cash flows from the discrete \nprojection period. The fair value of the reporting unit is calculated based on the sum of the present value of the cash flows from the discrete \nperiod and the present value of the terminal value. The discount rate represented our estimate of the weighted-average cost of capital \n(WACC), or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date. The application of our goodwill \nimpairment test required key assumptions underlying our valuation model. The discounted cash flow analysis factored in assumptions on \ndiscount rates and terminal growth rates to reflect risk profiles of key strategic revenue and cost initiatives, as well as revenue and EBITDA \ngrowth relative to history and market trends and expectations. The market multiples approach incorporated significant judgment involved in \nthe selection comparable public company multiples and benchmarks. The selection of companies was influenced by differences in growth and \nprofitability, and volatility in market prices of peer companies. These valuation inputs are inherently judgmental, and an adverse change in \none or a combination of these inputs could trigger a goodwill impairment loss in the future. \nA projected sustained decline in a reporting unit's revenues and earnings could have a significant negative impact on its fair value and may \nresult in impairment charges. Such a decline could be driven by, among other things: (1) more than anticipated increase in promotional \nactivity, decreases in sales volumes or long-term growth rate as a result of competitive pressures or other factors; or (2) the inability to \nachieve or delays in achieving the goals in strategic initiatives.

In connection with our ongoing review of the estimated useful lives of property, plant and \nequipment during 2021, we determined that the estimated useful life of our Property, plant and equipment would remain unchanged. We \nexpect that a one year increase in estimated useful lives of our Property, plant and equipment would result in a decrease to our 2021 \ndepreciation expense of $2.2 billion and that a one year decrease would result in an increase of approximately $3.5 billion in our 2021 \ndepreciation expense.\n43\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nAccounts Receivable \nPrior to January 1, 2020, accounts receivable were recorded at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts.

Our allowance for credit losses is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of assets \npooled together with similar risk characteristics. \nWe record an allowance to reduce the receivables to the amount that is expected to be collectible.

For wireless \nservice receivables and wireline consumer and small and medium business receivables, the allowance is calculated based on a 12 month \nrolling average write-off balance multiplied by the average life-cycle of an account from billing to write-off. The risk of loss is assessed over \nthe contractual life of the receivables and we adjust the historical loss amounts for current and future conditions based on management’s \nqualitative considerations. For global enterprise, public sector and wholesale wireline receivables, the allowance for credit losses is based on \nhistorical write-off experience and individual customer credit risk, if applicable. We consider multiple factors in determining the allowance as \ndiscussed above. \nIf there is a deterioration of our customers’ financial condition or if future actual default rates on receivables in general differ from those \ncurrently anticipated, we may have to adjust our allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are \nmade.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Verizon’s financial \nstatements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect \nto Verizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits \nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and \nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis \nfor our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was \ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit \nmatter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the \ncritical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n49\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nValuation of Employee Benefit Obligations \nDescription of the Matter The Company sponsors several pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans.

As \nexplained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to \nmeasure employee benefit obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to \nreflect the actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions. \nAuditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial \nassumptions (e.g., discount rate, health care cost trends, per capita claims cost trends and mortality rates) used in \nthe measurement process. These assumptions had a significant effect on the projected benefit obligation. \nHow We Addressed the \nMatter in Our Audit \nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the \nemployee benefits obligation valuation process. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of \nthe employee benefit obligation calculations, the significant actuarial assumptions and the data inputs provided \nto the actuary. \nTo test the employee benefit obligations, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the \nmethodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the \nCompany. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends, current economic \nfactors and evaluated the change in the employee benefit obligations from prior year due to the change in service \ncost, interest cost, actuarial gains and losses, benefit payments, contributions and other activities. In addition, we \ninvolved an actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management’s methodology for determining the discount \nrate that reflects the maturity and duration of the benefit payments and is used to measure the employee benefit \nobligations. As part of this assessment, we compared the projected cash flows to prior year projections and \ncompared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. To evaluate the health care cost \ntrends, per capita claims cost trends and the mortality rates, we involved an actuarial specialist to assist in \nevaluating the assumptions and assessed whether the information was consistent with publicly available \ninformation, and whether any market data adjusted for entity-specific adjustments were applied. We also tested \nthe completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to management’s \nactuarial specialists. \n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP \nErnst & Young LLP \nWe have served as Verizon's auditor since 2000. \nNew York, New York \nFebruary 11, 2022\n50\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Income \nVerizon Communications Inc. and Subsidiaries \n(dollars in mil",

These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and \nforward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable, including but not limited to the potential impacts arising from COVID-19 \npandemic and public and private sector policies and initiatives aimed at reducing its transmission. As the extent and duration of the impacts \nfrom COVID-19 remain unclear, the Company’s estimates and assumptions may evolve as conditions change. Actual results could differ \nsignificantly from those estimates. \nExamples of significant estimates include the allowance for credit losses, the recoverability of intangible assets, property, plant and \nequipment, and other long-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for the lease liability, fair value measurements, including those related \nto financial instruments, goodwill, spectrum licenses and intangible assets, unrecognized tax benefits, valuation allowances on tax assets, \npension and postretirement benefit obligations, contingencies and the identification and valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in \nconnection with business combinations. \nRevenue Recognition \nWe earn revenue from contracts with customers, primarily through the provision of telecommunications and other services and through the \nsale of wireless equipment.

For wireless service, we recognize revenue using an \noutput method, either as the service allowance units are used or as time elapses, because it reflects the pattern by which we satisfy our \nperformance obligation through the transfer of service to the customer. Monthly service is generally billed in advance, which results in a \ncontract liability. See Note 2 for additional information. For postpaid plans, where monthly usage exceeds the allowance, the overage usage \nrepresents options held by the customer for incremental services and the usage-based fee is recognized when the customer exercises the \noption (typically on a month-to-month basis). \nFor our contracts related to wireline communication and connectivity services, in general, fixed monthly fees for service are billed one month \nin advance, which results in a contract liability, and service revenue is recognized over the enforceable contract term as the service is \nrendered, as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services through network access and usage. While \nsubstantially all of our wireline service revenue contracts are the result of providing access to our networks, revenue from services that are not \nfixed in amount and, instead, are based on usage are generally billed in arrears and recognized as the usage occurs. \nEquipment \nWe sell wireless devices and accessories under the Verizon brand and other brands. Equipment revenue is generally recognized when the \nproducts are delivered to and accepted by the customer, as this is when control passes to the customer. In addition to offering the sale of \nequipment on a standalone basis, we have two primary offerings through which customers pay for a wireless device, in connection with a \nservice contract: fixed-term plans and device payment plans. \nUnder a fixed-term plan, the customer is sold the wireless device without any upfront charge or at a discounted price in exchange for entering \ninto a fixed-term service contract (typically for a term of 24 months or less). \nUnder a device payment plan, the customer is sold the wireless device in exchange for a non-interest-bearing installment note, which is repaid \nby the customer, typically over a 24 or 30-month ter",

The three-tier hierarchy for inputs used in \nmeasuring fair value, which prioritizes the inputs used in the methodologies of measuring fair value for assets and liabilities, is as follows: \nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities \nLevel 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities \nLevel 3 — Unobservable pricing inputs in the market \nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurements. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurements requires judgment and may affect the \nvaluation of the assets and liabilities being measured and their categorization within the fair value hierarchy. \nIncome Taxes \nOur effective tax rate is based on pre-tax income, statutory tax rates, tax laws and regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the \nvarious jurisdictions in which we operate. \nDeferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in the basis between financial statement and income tax assets and liabilities. \nDeferred income taxes are recalculated annually at tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be \nrealized or settled. We record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. \nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The first step is \nrecognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of \nany related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the \nmore-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full \nknowledge of all relevant information.

In connection with the incentive auction, a pre-tax net loss of $1.2 billion ($914 million after-tax) was \nrecorded in Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income during 2020 because the exchange of the \npreviously held licenses for new licenses had commercial substance. See Note 4 for additional information.

Verizon participated in the auction and was the high bidder \non 557 licenses in the 3.5 GHz band valued at approximately $1.9 billion for the licenses. Verizon made payments for these licenses in 2020 \nand received them from the FCC in March 2021. Upon receiving, these wireless licenses, including capitalized interest, based on qualifying \nactivities that occurred, were reclassified from Deposits for wireless licenses to Wireless licenses in our consolidated balance sheet. \nIn February 2021, the FCC concluded Auction 107 for C-Band wireless spectrum. Verizon was the winning bidder on 3,511 licenses, \nconsisting of contiguous C-Band spectrum bands ranging between 140 and 200 megahertz of C-Band spectrum in all 406 markets available in \nthe auction. Verizon paid $45.5 billion for the licenses it won, of which $44.6 billion was paid in the first quarter of 2021. In accordance with \nthe rules applicable to the auction, Verizon is required to make additional payments to acquire the licenses. The payments are for our  \nallocable share of clearing costs incurred by, and incentive payments due to, the incumbent license holders associated with the auction, which \nare estimated to be $7.7 billion. During 2021, we made payments of $1.3 billion primarily related to certain obligations for projected clearing \ncosts.

Leasing Arrangements \nWe enter into various lease arrangements for network equipment including towers, distributed antenna systems, small cells, real estate and \nconnectivity mediums including dark fiber, equipment, and other various types of assets for use in our operations. Our leases have remaining \nlease terms ranging from 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options that we can elect to extend the leases term for up to 25 years, and \nsome of which include options to terminate the leases. For the majority of leases entered into during the current period, we have concluded it \nis not reasonably certain that we would exercise the options to extend the lease or terminate the lease. Therefore, as of the lease \ncommencement date, our lease terms generally do not include these options. We include options to extend the lease when it is reasonably \ncertain that we will exercise that option. \nDuring March 2015, we completed a transaction with American Tower Corporation (American Tower) pursuant to which American Tower \nacquired the exclusive rights to lease and operate approximately 11,300 of our wireless towers for an upfront payment of $5.0 billion. We \nhave subleased capacity on the towers from American Tower for a minimum of 10 years at current market rates in 2015, with options to \nrenew. We continue to include the towers in Property, plant and equipment, net in our consolidated balance sheets and depreciate them \naccordingly. In addition to the rights to lease and operate the towers, American Tower assumed the interest in the underlying ground leases \nrelated to these towers. While American Tower can renegotiate the terms of and is responsible for paying the ground leases, we are still the \nprimary obligor for these leases and accordingly, the present value of these ground leases are included in our operating lease right-of-use \nassets and operating lease liabilities.

Verizon’s experience has been that the payment attributes \nof longer tenured customers are highly predictive for estimating their reliability to make future payments. Customers with longer tenures tend \nto exhibit similar risk characteristics to other customers with longer tenures, and receivables due from customers with longer tenures tend to \nperform better than receivables from customers that have not previously been Verizon customers. As a result of this experience, we make \ninitial lending decisions based upon whether the customers are \"established customers\" or \"short-tenured customers.\" If a Consumer customer \nhas been a customer for 45 days or more, or if a Business customer has been a customer for 12 months or more, the customer is considered an \n\"established customer.\" For established customers, the credit decision and ongoing credit monitoring processes rely on a combination of \ninternal and external data sources. If a Consumer customer has been a customer less than 45 days, or a Business customer has been a customer \nfor less than 12 months, the customer is considered a \"short-tenured customer.\" For short-tenured customers, the credit decision and credit \nmonitoring processes rely more heavily on external data sources. \nInternal data and/or external credit data are obtained from the credit reporting agencies, if available, to create a custom credit risk score for \nConsumer customers.

To determine the aggregate return for the \npension trust, the projected return of each individual asset class is then weighted according to the allocation to that investment area in the \ntrust’s long-term asset allocation policy. \nThe assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows: \nHealth Care and Life \nAt December 31,\n2021\n2020\n2019 \nWeighted-average healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year\n 6.20 %\n 6.20 %\n 6.30 % \nRate to which cost trend rate gradually declines\n 4.50 \n 4.50 \n 4.50 \nYear the rate reaches the level it is assumed to remain thereafter\n2029\n2029\n2027 \nPlan Assets \nThe Company’s overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of assets that allows us to meet projected benefit payments while taking into \nconsideration risk and return. While target allocation percentages will vary over time, the current target allocation for plan assets is designed \nso that 45% to 55% of the assets have the objective of achieving a return in excess of the growth in liabilities (comprised of public equities, \nprivate equities, real estate, hedge funds, high yield bonds and emerging market debt) and 44% to 54% of the assets are invested as liability \nhedging assets (where interest rate sensitivity of the liability hedging assets better match the interest rate sensitivity of the liability) and a \nmaximum of 10% is in cash. This allocation will shift as funded status improves to a higher allocation of liability hedging assets. Target \npolicies will be revisited periodically to ensure they are in line with fund objectives. Both active and passive management approaches are used \ndepending on perceived market efficiencies and various other factors. Due to our diversification and risk control processes, there are no \nsignificant concentrations of risk, in terms of sector, industry, geography or company names. \nPension and healthcare and life plans assets do not include significant amounts of Verizon common stock.\n91\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nPension Plans \nThe fair values for the pension plans by asset category at December 31, 2021 are as follows: \n(dollars in millions) \nAsset Category\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3 \nCash and cash equivalents\n$ \n1,221 \n$ \n1,208 \n$ \n13 \n$ \n— \nEqui",

The carrying value of \ncash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these investments. \nInvestments in securities traded on national and foreign securities exchanges are valued by the trustee at the last reported sale prices on the \nlast business day of the year or, if no sales were reported on that date, at the last reported bid prices. Government obligations, corporate bonds, \ninternational bonds and asset-backed debt are valued using matrix prices with input from independent third-party valuation sources. Over-the-\ncounter securities are valued at the bid prices or the average of the bid and ask prices on the last business day of the year from published \nsources or, if not available, from other sources considered reliable such as multiple broker quotes. \nCommingled funds not traded on national exchanges are priced by the custodian or fund's administrator at their net asset value (NAV). \nCommingled funds held by third-party custodians appointed by the fund managers provide the fund managers with a NAV. The fund \nmanagers have the responsibility for providing this information to the custodian of the respective plan. \nThe investment manager of the entity values venture capital, corporate finance and natural resource limited partnership investments. Real \nestate investments are valued at amounts based upon appraisal reports prepared by either independent real estate appraisers or the investment \nmanager using discounted cash flows or market comparable data. Loans secured by mortgages are carried at the lesser of the unpaid balance \nor appraised value of the underlying properties. The values assigned to these investments are based upon available and current market \ninformation and do not necessarily represent amounts that might ultimately be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, \nestimated fair values might differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed. These \ndifferences could be material. \nForward currency contracts, futures, and options are valued by the trustee at the exchange rates and market prices prevailing on the last \nbusiness day of the year.

The amount of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next \ntwelve months due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in various jurisdictions and it is reasonably possible that various current tax \nexaminations will conclude or require reevaluations of the Company’s tax positions during this period. An estimate of the range of the \npossible change cannot be made until these tax matters are further developed or resolved. \nNote 13. Segment Information \nReportable Segments \nWe have two reportable segments that we operate and manage as strategic business units - Consumer and Business. We measure and evaluate \nour reportable segments based on segment operating income, consistent with the chief operating decision maker’s assessment of segment \nperformance. \nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following: \nSegment\nDescription \nVerizon \nConsumer Group \nOur Consumer segment provides consumer-focused wireless and wireline communications services and products. \nOur wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the Verizon \nbrand and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide fixed wireless access (FWA) broadband \nthrough our wireless networks. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern \nU.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our Verizon Fios product portfolio and \nover a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios. \nVerizon \nBusiness Group \nOur Business segment provides wireless and wireline communications services and products, including data, video \nand conferencing services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long \ndistance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We also provide FWA \nbroadband through our wireless networks. We provide these products and services to businesses, government \ncustomers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and select products and services to customers around the \nworld. \nOur Consumer segment's wireless and wireline products and services are available to our retail customers, as well as resellers that purchase \nwireless network access from us on a wholesale basis. Our Business segment’s wireless and wireline products and services are organized by \nthe primary customer groups targeted by these offerings: Small and Medium Business, Global Enterprise, Public Sector and Other, and \nWholesale. \nCorporate and other primarily includes insurance captives, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that \nsupport our strategic ini",

Although such transactions \nare excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings.

Equity and Comprehensive Income \nEquity \nIn December 2019, 46,100 preferred shares of a foreign affiliate of Verizon was sold for cash consideration of $51 million and is reflected in \nnon-controlling interests. The preferred shares pay cumulative dividends of 8.25% per annum. \nCommon Stock \nIn February 2020, the Verizon Board of Directors authorized a share buyback program to repurchase up to 100 million shares of Verizon's \ncommon stock. The program will terminate when the aggregate number of shares purchased reaches 100 million, or a new share repurchase \nplan superseding the current plan is authorized, whichever is sooner. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Verizon did \nnot repurchase any shares of Verizon’s common stock under our current or previously authorized share buyback programs. At December 31, \n2021, the maximum number of shares that could be purchased by or on behalf of Verizon under our share buyback program was 100 million. \nCommon stock has been used from time to time to satisfy some of the funding requirements of employee and shareholder plans. During the \nyears ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we issued 2.1 million, 2.3 million and 3.8 million common shares from treasury stock, \nrespectively, which had an insignificant aggregate value. \nIn connection with our acquisition of Tracfone in November 2021, we issued approximately 57.6 million shares of Verizon common shares \nfrom treasury stock valued at approximately $3.0 billion. See Note 3 for additional information. \nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) \nComprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP, are excluded from net \nincome.

Where it is determined, in consultation with counsel based on litigation and settlement risks, that a loss is probable and estimable in a \ngiven matter, the Company establishes an accrual. In none of the currently pending matters is the amount of accrual material. An estimate of \nthe reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amounts already accrued cannot be made at this time due to various factors \ntypical in contested proceedings, including: (1) uncertain damage theories and demands; (2) a less than complete factual record; \n(3) uncertainty concerning legal theories and their resolution by courts or regulators; and (4) the unpredictable nature of the opposing party \nand its demands.

These cases have progressed to various stages and a small number may go to trial \nin the coming 12 months if they are not otherwise resolved. \nIn connection with the execution of agreements for the sales of businesses and investments, Verizon ordinarily provides representations and \nwarranties to the purchasers pertaining to a variety of nonfinancial matters, such as ownership of the securities being sold, as well as \nindemnity from certain financial losses. From time to time, counterparties may make claims under these provisions, and Verizon will seek to \ndefend against those claims and resolve them in the ordinary course of business. \nSubsequent to the sale of Verizon Information Services Canada in 2004, we continue to provide a guarantee to publish directories, which was \nissued when the directory business was purchased in 2001 and had a 30-year term (before extensions). The preexisting guarantee continues, \nwithout modification, despite the subsequent sale of Verizon Information Services Canada and the spin-off of our domestic print and internet \nyellow pages directories business. The possible financial impact of the guarantee, which is not expected to be adverse, cannot be reasonably \nestimated as a variety of the potential outcomes available under the guarantee result in costs and revenues or benefits that may offset each \nother. We do not believe performance under the guarantee is likely. \nAs of December 31, 2021, letters of credit totaling approximately $674 million, which were executed in the normal course of business and \nsupport several financing arrangements and payment obligations to third parties, were outstanding. \nDuring 2021, Verizon entered into seven renewable energy purchase agreements (REPAs) with third parties, in addition to 13 signed in \nprevious years. Each of the REPAs is based on the expected operation of a renewable energy-generating facility and has a fixed price term of \n12 to 18 years from the commencement of the facility's entry into commercial operation, which is expected to occur through 2024, as \napplicable. The REPAs generally are expected to be financially settled based on the prevailing market price as energy is generated by the \nfacilities. \nWe have various unconditional purchase obligations, which represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and \nlegally binding. We estimate that these unconditional purchase obligations, for contracts with terms in excess of one year, total $29.8 billion, \nand primarily represent commitments to purchase network equipment, software and services, content, marketing services and other items \nwhich will be used or sold in the ordinary course of business from a variety of suppliers.

Based on this evaluation, \nour Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective \nas of December 31, 2021. \nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nIn the ordinary course of business, we routinely review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our \nsystems and processes that are intended to ensure an effective internal control environment. In the third quarter of 2020, we began a multi-\nyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which will replace many of our existing core financial \nsystems. The new ERP system is designed to enhance the flow of financial information, facilitate data analysis and accelerate information \nreporting. The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.\n103\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K\n\n\nAs the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we could have changes to our processes and procedures which, in turn, \ncould result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting.

Management has evaluated internal control over financial reporting of the company using the criteria for effective \ninternal control established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \nCommission in 2013. \nIn accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their \nfirst assessment of internal control over financial reporting following the date of acquisition. Based on those guidelines, management's \nassessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting excluded TracFone Wireless, Inc. (Tracfone), which \nthe Company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the \nCompany's acquisition of Tracfone. We have included the financial results of this acquisition in the consolidated financial statements from the \ndate of acquisition. Tracfone represented approximately 3% of consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2021, and less than 1% of \nconsolidated total revenues for the year then ended. \nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. Based on this \nassessment, management believes that the internal control over financial reporting of the company is effective as of December 31, 2021. In \nconnection with this assessment, there were no material weaknesses in the company’s internal control over financial reporting identified by \nmanagement. The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has provided an attestation report on the \ncompany’s internal control over financial reporting and is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. \nItem 9B.
