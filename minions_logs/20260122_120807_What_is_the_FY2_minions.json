Respond to the question by assuming the perspective of an investment analyst who can only use the details shown within the statement of cash flows.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 1121715 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine the FY2021 capital expenditure amount for PepsiCo from the statement of cash flows, focus on the section typically labeled as \"Cash Flows from Investing Activities.\" Within this section, look for line items related to \"Capital Expenditures\" or \"Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment.\" These entries represent the cash outflows for capital investments during the fiscal year. The amount will be listed in millions or billions of USD, so ensure to convert it to billions if necessary. As an investment analyst, it's crucial to verify that the figure corresponds specifically to FY2021 and to cross-reference any notes or additional disclosures that might provide context or clarification on the capital expenditure figures."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Make sure to use **as much** information from the outputs as possible in final aggregated str (output.answer, output.sample, output.explanation, output.citation)\n\n        Note: Job has following attributes:\n        - manifest: JobManifest(chunk, task, advice, chunk_id, task_id, job_id)\n        - sample: entire response from the worker\n        - output: JobOutput(answer=\"\". explanation=\"\", citation=\"\", raw=\"\")\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n\n```\n\n## Chunking Function\n```\ndef chunk_by_section(\n    doc: str, max_chunk_size: int = 3000, overlap: int = 20\n) -> List[str]:\n\n```\n\n## Important Reminders:\n- **DO NOT** assign tasks that require reading multiple chunks or referencing entire documents.\n- Keep tasks **chunk-local and atomic**.\n- **You** (the supervisor) are responsible for aggregating and interpreting outputs in `transform_outputs()`. \n\nNow, please provide the code for `prepare_jobs()` and `transform_outputs()`.  They should both be included in a single code block.\n\n\n",

The `transform_outputs` function then filters and aggregates the outputs from these tasks, focusing on the answers, explanations, and citations provided by the worker model."

Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and\nfinancing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash\navailable for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not\ndeducted from the measure.\nSee “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information.\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability\nWe define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average\ndebt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous\nmethods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the\nmethods other companies use to calculate their ROIC.\nWe believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate retu",

However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace\ndamaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they\nexpect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a\nresult, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms.

Sales incentives and discounts also include\nsupport provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\nA number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on\nannual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur\nafter year end once reconciled and settled.

Brand development costs are expensed\nas incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is\nfirst assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values,\nwith any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those\nrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life\ncycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash\nflows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.\nWe believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the\nintent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria\nare not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the\nexpected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market\nshare, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the\nmacroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.\nIn connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights\nto manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,\nmany factors were considered, including the pre-\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nexisting perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash\nflows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory,\ncontractual, competitive, economic or other factors.

We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more\nfrequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment,\nfirst we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include\nmacroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory\nenvironment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment\nindicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair\nvalue of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using\ndiscounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with\nmanagement’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of\nassumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant\nmanagement judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including\nthose related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used\nin our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including\nperpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are\nconsistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our\nresults. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our\nBusiness Risks.”\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic\nenvironment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its\nestimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\nSee Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nIncome Tax Expense and Accruals\nOur annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing\narrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate.

As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our\ntax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return,\nand some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and\nliabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future\nyears for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation\nallowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of\nthe deferred tax assets will be realized.

Annual pension and retiree\nmedical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working\nduring the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and\n(3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on\nassets for our funded plans.\nSignificant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:\n•\ncertain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\n•\nthe expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans;\n•\nthe spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities;\n•\nfor pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and\n•\nfor retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates.\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nCertain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All\nactuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a\ncurtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact\non the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.\nAt each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with\nmaturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the\ndiscount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and\namount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’\ninvestment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given\nyear do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.\nThe health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually.

In addition, we include our share of the results of certain\nother affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence\nover the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control\nthese other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions\nare eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan\nsubsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period\npresented.\nRaw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production\nplanning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and\ndelivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported\namounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in\ndetermining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical\naccruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-\nlived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical\nexperience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and\nadjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect\ncannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nOur fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53  reporting week every five or six years, including in\nour 2022 financial results.

Similarly, our policy\nfor certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based\non estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms.

We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more\nfrequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment,\nfirst we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include\nmacroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory\nenvironment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment\nindicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair\nvalue of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using\ndiscounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with\nmanagement’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of\nassumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant\nmanagement judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including\nthose related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used\nin our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including\nperpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are\nconsistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our\nresults.\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic\nenvironment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its\nestimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows.\nSee Note 4 for further information.\nOther Significant Accounting Policies\nOur other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows:\n•\nBas",

This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two\nyears.\nMethod of Accounting and Our Assumptions\nThe fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to\nemployees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the\ndate that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition,\nwe use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are\nexpected to vest.\nWe do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require\nshareholder approval under the LTIP.\nStock Options\nA stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee\nstock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense\nat the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date\nof grant and generally have a 10-year term.\nOur weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:\n2021\n2020\n2019\nExpected life\n7 years\n6 years\n5 years\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.1 %\n0.9 %\n2.4 %\nExpected volatility\n14 %\n14 %\n14 %\nExpected dividend yield\n3.1 %\n3.4 %\n3.1 %\nThe expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options.

As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $70 million in 2021,\nprimarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.\nIn 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of\ncertain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H),\neffective January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization facilitated a more\ntargeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. There was\nno material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reorganization.\nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan\nH. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service\ncost expense.\nIn 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and\nadminister future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220\nmillion ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share).\nAlso in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option\nof receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’s pension benefit. This transaction\ntriggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively, the group\nannuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement\ncharges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share).\n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\nGains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual\nreturn on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each\nmeasurement date.

Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan\nassets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return\nexpectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to\nreduce interest rate and foreign currency risks.

Our responsibility is to express an\nopinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial\nreporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board\n(United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material\nrespects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of\nthe consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as\nwell as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk.\nOur audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our\naudits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n108\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, acc",

Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or\ncomplex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSales incentive accruals\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through\nvarious programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the\nneed to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current\nliabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding\ncustomer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and\ncomplex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference\nbetween when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer\nand consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical\nexperience and trends.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the d",

We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related\nto (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance\nlevels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical\nperiods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales\nincentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2)\nrecalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis,\n109\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbased on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales\nincentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements\nor claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual.\nCarrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its\nindefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and\nchanges in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value\nof indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 25, 2021 was $35.5 billion which represents 38% of total assets, and\nincludes PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value\nof $8.6 billion as of December 25, 2021.\nWe identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of\nEurope’s juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the\nimpact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The\nimpairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the\nCompany’s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of\nthe discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite-lived assets impairment process,\nincluding controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth\nrates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows.

We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating\n(1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to\nthe respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local\ncountries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were\nindependently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income\ntax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 25, 2021, the\nCompany recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes\nthat certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though\nthe Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well\nas the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court\nrulings or tax authority settlements.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the\napplication of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is\n110\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncomplex and involves subjective judgment.

We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including\ncontrols to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to\nestimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing\nunrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements.

We have summarized certain portions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-\nLaws below. The summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are incorporated by reference as exhibits\nto the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part. You should read the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for\nthe provisions that are important to you.\nGeneral\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two-thirds\ncents (1-2/3 cents) per share. As of February 3, 2022, there\n    \n    \n\n\nwere 1,383,451,400 shares of common stock outstanding which were held of record by 101,778 shareholders.\nVoting Rights.

Action on a matter generally requires that the votes\ncast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast in opposition. A plurality vote is required in an election of the Board of Directors\nwhere the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.\nDividend Rights. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by\nPepsiCo’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor.\nRights Upon Liquidation. Holders of our common stock are entitled to share pro rata, upon any liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of PepsiCo, in all remaining assets available for distribution to shareholders after payment or providing for PepsiCo’s\nliabilities.\nPreemptive Rights.

Our By-Laws provide that shareholders must provide timely written\nnotice to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual\nmeeting of shareholders. Notice for\n2\n\n\nan annual meeting is generally timely if it is received at our principal office not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to\nthe first anniversary of the preceding year’s annual meeting. However, if the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than\n30 days or delayed more than 60 days from this anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year, such\nnotice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the annual meeting and not later than the close\nof business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following the day on which public\nannouncement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. Shareholders utilizing “proxy access” must meet separate\ndeadlines. The By-Laws also specify the form and content of a shareholder’s notice. These provisions may prevent shareholders\nfrom bringing matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or from nominating candidates for election as directors at an\nannual meeting of shareholders.\nProxy Access. Our By-Laws contain “proxy access” provisions which give an eligible shareholder (or a group of up to 20\nshareholders aggregating their shares) that has owned 3% or more of the outstanding common stock continuously for at least\nthree years the right to nominate the greater of two nominees and 20% of the number of directors to be elected at the applicable\nannual general meeting, and to have those nominees included in our proxy materials, subject to the other terms and conditions of\nour By-Laws.\nSpecial Meetings. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by resolution of the\nBoard or by our corporate secretary upon written request of one or more shareholders holding shares of record representing at\nleast 20% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Any such special meeting called at\nthe request of our shareholders will be held at such date, time and place (if any) as may be fixed by our Board, provided that the\ndate of such special meeting may not be more than 90 days from the receipt of such request by the corporate secretary.

The Act applies to PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods.\nThis statute could discourage a third party from making a partial tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain a\nsubstantial position in our equity securities or seeking to obtain control of us. It also might limit the price that certain investors\nmight be willing to pay in the future for our shares of common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change\nof control of us.\nDESCRIPTION OF NOTES\nWe have previously filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-177307), which was filed with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 13, 2011 and covers the issuance of the sterling notes and 2026 notes, a\nregistration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-197640), which was filed with the SEC on July 25, 2014 and covers the\nissuance of the July 2028 notes, a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-216082), which was filed with the SEC on\nFebruary 15, 2017 and covers the issuance of the 2027 notes, 2031 notes and 2039 notes and a registration statement on Form S-3\n(File No. 333-234767), which was filed with the SEC on November 18, 2019 and covers the issuance of the 2024 notes, May\n2028 notes, 2032 notes, 2033 notes and 2050 notes.\nThe notes were issued under an indenture dated as of May 21, 2007 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon, as\ntrustee (the “indenture”).

The amendment and restatement referred to in the prior sentence remains in effect, and it sets forth the terms of the\n“DB Program.”\n    Effective January 1, 2011, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit\nselected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of\ntheir home countries for whom it is judged to be impractical to have them participate in their home country retirement plans, and\nemployees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages). The terms of the DC\nProgram are set forth in this document, which is the governing legal document for the DC Program. Together, the DC Program\nand the DB Program set forth the terms of a single Plan. The DC Program is also sometimes referred to in employee\ncommunications as the PepsiCo International Pension Plan or “PIPP.”\n    The DC Program was previously amended and restated, effective as of January 1, 2016. As part of that amendment and\nrestatement, the Corporation modified the DC Program to also benefit selected employees: (i) who are localized to a country\noutside of their home country, (ii) were participating in a defined benefit or defined contribution retirement program sponsored\nimmediately prior to their localization and (iii) for whom no company-provided retirement program is available.\n    The DC Program was again amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2019.

This document (the “Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document”) was first effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2005 (the “Effective Date”) and was restated to reflect amendments through December 31, 2008. It\ngenerally retained without modification the provisions of the 1989 restatement.

The 2016 restatement of the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document was effective as of\nApril 1, 2016. There were no material modifications made to the Pre-409A PepsiCo PEP Document as a result of the\n2016 restatement.

On April 6, 1999, when this Plan became effective, PBG had its initial public offering.

This restatement of the 409A Program Document is\neffective as of January 1, 2022. Before this restatement, the 409A Program Document was most recently restated\neffective as of January 1, 2021, and prior to that, effective as of January 1, 2019, and prior to that, effective as of\nJanuary 1, 2017.\nInterplay of this 409A Program and Pre-409A Program. All benefits under the Plan that are not subject\nto the 409A Program (i.e., generally, benefits that are earned or vested before January 1, 2005 and not materially\nmodified thereafter within the meaning of Treas. Reg. § 1.409A-6(a)(4)) shall be governed by the Plan Document for\nthe Pre-Section 409 Program (the “Pre-409A Program”). Together, this document and the document for the Pre-409A\nProgram describe the terms of a single plan. However, amounts subject to the terms of this 409A Program and\namounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program shall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of\nthe terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification, and the separation between the 409A Program\namounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to be sufficient to permit the pre-409A Program to remain\nexempt from Section 409A as grandfathered benefits.\nFreeze of the Salaried Plan. In general, the Plan provides benefits that make up for benefits that would\naccrue under the Salaried Plan but for certain Code limitations on benefits and compensation that apply to the\nSalaried Plan. As a result, a Participant’s accrual of Plan benefits and a Participant’s growing into certain benefit\nenhancements (such as more favorable early commencement factors) are generally tied to the Participant’s accrual\nof benefits and growing into benefit enhancements under the Salaried Plan. For certain\n- 2 -\nPepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program\n\n\nParticipants, there are special provisions in Section 5.2 (the “PEP Guarantee”) or the Appendix that provide a benefit\naccrual opportunity that goes beyond providing a make up for the application of Code limitations to the Salaried Plan.\nRegardless, however, the freeze on accruals under the Salaried Plan that is effective as of the end of the day on\nDecember 31, 2025 also freezes all accruals under this Plan effective as of that time.

In the event the Plan is amended to provide\nnew rights, features or benefits, the following actuarial factors shall not apply to these new elements unless\nspecifically adopted by the amendment.\n(1)    Annuities and Inflation Protection: To determine the amount of a Pension payable in\nthe form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity or optional form of survivor annuity, as an annuity\nwith inflation protection, or as a period certain and life annuity, the Plan Administrator shall select the\nfactors that are to be used.

Any decisions or determinations hereunder shall be made in the absolute and\nunrestricted discretion of the Plan Administrator, even if (i) such discretion is not expressly granted by the Plan\nprovisions in question, or (ii) a decision or determination is not expressly called for by the Plan provisions in question,\nand even though other Plan provisions expressly grant discretion or expressly call for a decision or determination. All\ndecisions and determinations made by the Plan Administrator will be final, conclusive, and binding on all parties. The\nPlan Administrator may consider the intent of the Company with respect to a Plan provision in making any\ndetermination with respect to the provision, notwithstanding the provisions set forth in any document that arguably do\nnot contemplate considering such intent. The Plan Administrator’s discretion is absolute, and in any case where the\nbreadth of the Plan Administrator’s discretion is at issue, it is expressly intended that the Plan Administrator (or its\ndelegate) be accorded the maximum possible discretion. Any exercise by the Plan Administrator of its discretionary\nauthority shall be reviewed by a court under the arbitrary and capricious standard (i.e., abuse of discretion). If,\npursuant to this discretionary authority, an assertion of any right to a benefit by or on behalf of a Participant or\nbeneficiary (a “claimant”) is wholly or partially denied, the Plan Administrator, or a party designated by the Plan\nAdministrator, will provide such claimant within the 90-day period following the receipt of the claim by the Plan\nAdministrator, a comprehensible written notice setting forth:\n(a)    The specific reason or r",

(“PBG”) established the PBG Pension Equalization Plan (“PEP”\nor “Plan”) effective April 6, 1999 for the benefit of salaried employees of the PBG Organization who participate in the\nPBG Salaried Employees Retirement Plan (“Salaried Plan”). The Plan was initially established as a successor plan to\nthe PepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan, due to PBG’s April 6, 1999 initial public offering, and the Plan included\nhistorical PepsiCo provisions which are relevant for eligibility and benefit determinations under the Plan. The Plan\nprovides benefits for eligible employees whose pension benefits under the\n- 147 -\nPepsiCo Pension Equalization Plan –409A Program\n\n\nSalaried Plan are limited by the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, the Plan\nprovides benefits for certain eligible employees based on the pre-1989 Salaried Plan formula. Effective April 1, 2009,\nthe Plan also provides benefits for employees whose eligible pay under the Salaried Plan is reduced due to the\nemployees’ elective deferrals under the PBG Executive Income Deferral Program and for certain executives who\nwould be “Grandfathered Participants” under the Salaried Plan but for their classification as salary band E3-E8 or MP\n(or its equivalent, for periods on and after the Effective Time). The Plan is intended as a nonqualified unfunded\ndeferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the Plan that provides benefits\nbased on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is intended to be an “excess\nbenefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA. The remainder of the Plan is intended to be a plan described\nin Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of ERISA providing benefits to a select group of management or highly-\ncompensated employees.\nThe Plan has been amended from time to time, most recently in the form of an amendment and complete restatement\neffective as of April 1, 2009 (“2009 Restatement”). PBG further amended the Plan as a result of the merger of PBG\nwith and into Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc. (the\n“Company”), pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 3, 2009 among PBG, the Company\nand Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Company, Inc., and to facilitate the Company’s assumption of PBG’s role as the Plan’s\nsponsor.\n1.2    Effect of Amendment and Restatement.

      "output": "From the collected job outputs, we have a mix of responses. Most outputs indicate that no capital expenditure amount for PepsiCo's fiscal year 2021 was found in the given document excerpts. However, there are a few outputs that provide specific figures:\n\n1. One output mentions a capital expenditure amount of $4.5 billion, citing a section that discusses net cash used for investing activities.\n2. Another output mentions $4.2 billion, but this seems to be related to acquisitions rather than direct capital expenditures.\n3. Two outputs mention $4,625 million, with one specifying it as a negative value, which aligns with typical financial reporting where expenditures are shown as outflows.\n4. Another output mentions $4,519, but the context seems unclear.\n\nGiven these findings, the most consistent and relevant figure appears to be $4,625 million, as it is mentioned twice and aligns with the context of capital spending. The citation for this figure indicates it was extracted from a section labeled 'Cash Flows from Investing Activities', which is the correct section to find capital expenditures.\n\nTherefore, the FY2021 capital expenditure amount for PepsiCo, based on the statement of cash flows, is likely $4.625 billion. This conclusion is drawn from the consistency of the figure across multiple outputs and its alignment with the expected financial reporting format."
