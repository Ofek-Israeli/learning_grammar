Total length: 562014 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To address the question about Amcor's year-end FY2020 net accounts receivable (AR) in USD millions, focus on extracting specific information from the balance sheet section of the financial document. The critical information includes identifying the line item labeled as \"Accounts Receivable\" or \"Net Accounts Receivable\" for the fiscal year 2020. It's important to ensure that the figure is presented in USD millions, as financial documents may sometimes present figures in different currencies or units. Additionally, verify that the figure is net of any allowances for doubtful accounts, as this will provide the net AR value. If the balance sheet includes comparative figures for previous years, ensure you are referencing the correct fiscal year, which is FY2020 in this case."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The `transform_outputs` function then collects and aggregates the results from each chunk, filtering out any empty or irrelevant outputs. This approach ensures that the task is handled in a chunk-local manner, allowing for efficient processing and aggregation of the necessary financial data."

To fulfill our aspiration, we are\ndetermined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment.\nFocused portfolio\n        Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics:\n•\nA focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,\n•\ngood industry structure,\n•\nattractive relative growth, and\n•\nmultiple paths for us to win from our leadership position, scale and other competitive advantages.\n        These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.\nDifferentiated capabilities\n        \"The Amcor Way\" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership,\nInnovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline.\nShareholder value creation\n        Through our portfolio of focused business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value. The defensive nature of\nour end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time value creation has been strong and consistent through paying dividends\nand growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets and pursuing targeted acquisitions or by returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks.\n6\n\n\nSegment Information\n        Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set\nforth in ASC 280, the Company has determined it has two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reporting segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons,\nand closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to\nNote 20, \"Segments,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reporting segments.\nFlexibles Segment\n        The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 40,000 employees at 181 principal manufacturing facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2020, the\nFlexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2020, Flexibles accounted for approximately 78% of the Company’s\nconsolidated net sales.\nRigid Packaging Segment\n        The Rigid Packaging Segment manufacturers rigid packaging containers and related products in the Ameri",

Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America,\nAfrica and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design\ntechnicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization.\n        We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020. Sales to PepsiCo, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11.1% and 11.0%\nof our sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Business arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these\nbusiness arrangements would typically occur over a period of time.\n         The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive.

These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are\nnot significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials.

We have a\nnumber of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks\ncollectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our\nreporting segments. Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise.\nSustainability, Innovation and Environmental Laws and Regulations\n        We believe there will always be a role for the primary packages made by Amcor. Packaging protects and preserves food and healthcare products, and reduces the carbon footprint and waste of\nproducts. It extends shelf life and reduces food\nand other product loss across a range of distribution channels. Consumers want cost effective, convenient and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution to reduce waste. We believe\nresponsible packaging is the answer to achieve less waste through innovative packaging design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation.\n        Amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success. In January 2018, we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our\npackaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world.\n        We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents. We collaborate with customers, suppliers, and innovators to create industry-leading solutions, and\nwith stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection, sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the environmental implications of their packaging. We are uniquely\npositioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging. Addressing the need for and increasing the supply of responsible packaging is one of the\nmost important growth opportunities for Amcor.\n        Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions.

Consequently, changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that\nwe serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions, may result\nin a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products. Although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining\nsales, there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand.

From time to time, a\nsingle customer, depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations, may account for 10% or more of our revenue. Sales to our largest customer\naccounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of our net sales in 2020 or sales to any other\ncustomer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in these fiscal periods.\n        Customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production\nrequirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net profit.\n        There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors, change to alternative forms of packaging, begin\nmanufacturing their packaging products in-house or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before.\n        Any loss, change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which\neffect may be material.\n        In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines.

However, we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control. Our ability to grow organically may be\nlimited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions, strategic\npriorities or otherwise.

The coronavirus may result in a prolonged economic downturn,\nsuch as increased unemployment, decreases in capital spending, business shutdowns, or economic recessions, which could negatively affect demand for our customers’ products. Despite our efforts to\nmanage these impacts, the extent to which the coronavirus or other outbreaks impact our business and operations, including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates, is unknown and the effect\ncould be material.\nGlobal Operations — Challenging current and future global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and financial results.\n        Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products, including packaged food, beverage, healthcare, personal care, agribusiness, industrial, and\nother consumer goods.

In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct\nAuthority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), a new index calculated by\nshort-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.\n        Certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR, if necessary. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate some financing\nagreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest\nrate, however, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of\nsuch a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nExchange Rates — We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk.\n        We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk, both transactional and translational, which may negatively affect our financial performance.

In particular, our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the\nexchange rate between the Euro and the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subject to further movement.\n        Exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly. For instance, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian Real have experienced significant pressures as growth and other concerns,\nincluding those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have weighed on the Mexican and Brazilian economies, respectively. In addition, we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the\ncurrency devaluation in Argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\" of the notes to consolidated financial\nstatements for further information regarding highly inflationary accounting.\n        To the extent currency devaluation continues across our business, we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through U.S. dollar-denominated input costs across our business, which\nwould adversely impact our margins and profitability.

We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in\ncircumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. These methods include the use of a\ndiscount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill\nand/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes\nin our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or\nintangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of\noperations and net worth.

During fiscal year 2020, approximately 47,000 Amcor employees generated $12.5 billion in sales from operations that spanned approximately 231 locations in over 40 countries. \nSignificant Items Affecting the Periods Presented\nImpact of COVID-19\n        The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") has introduced a period of unprecedented uncertainty and challenge. Amcor’s operations have been largely recognized as 'essential' by governments\nand authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chains for critical food and healthcare products. Our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and\nsuppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers. In dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by COVID-19, we have established three guiding principles\nfocusing on the health and safety of our employees, keeping our operations running and contributing to relief efforts in our communities.\nHealth and Safety\n        Our commitment to the health and safety of its employees remains our first priority. Our rigorous precautionary measures include the formation of global and regional response teams that\nmaintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation, restrictions on company travel, quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms,\nfrequent disinfecting of Amcor locations and other measures designed to help protect employees, customers and suppliers. We expect to continue these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is\nadequately contained for our business.\nOperations and Supply Chain\n        To support our business partners, we have instituted business continuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which address infection prevention measures, incident response,\nreturn to work protocols and supply chain risks. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. However, we have\nexperienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future. For instance,\nin April, our Rigid Packaging Segment sales volumes in North America and Latin America were adversely impacted as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and on-the-go channels.\nOur facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expect that our operations will remain operational given the\nessential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities, it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result ",

However, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact\non the global economy and our operations and financial results. The ultimate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across\nthe supply chain, the duration of social distancing measures and other government imposed restrictions and the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies.\n25\n\n\nThe Acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc.\n        On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc.

In connection with the Bemis transaction, we assumed $1.4 billion of debt.\n2019 Bemis Integration Plan\n        In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization. As previously\nannounced, we continue to target realizing approximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year\n2022.\n        Our total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integration costs are expected to be approximately $200 million. The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring\nand related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in\nfixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. We estimate that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration\ncosts will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures.

The restructuring related costs\nrelate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics, train new employees on relocated equipment and anticipated loss on sale of closed facilities.\nOther Restructuring Plans\n        On August 21, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging (\"2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan\") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint.\nThe Plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost\nreductions.\n        Our total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 million with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing\nfacilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash impairments.\nWe estimate that approximately $70 million of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million. The 2018 Rigid Packaging\nRestructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021.\n        On June 9, 2016, we announced a major initiative (\"2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan\") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative was\ndesigned to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the cost\nbase and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market.\n        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, we had closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. Our total pre-tax restructuring costs were $230.8\nmillion, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment\nand terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million in total program costs resulted in cash expenditures.

These measures exclude the impact of significant tax reform, certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates,\nacquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses\non sales of significant property and divestitures, certain litigation matters, pension settlements and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses,\nprofessional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, and changes in the fair value of deferred acquisition payments.\n        This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined under U.S. GAAP.

This increase was\nprimarily due to higher disposal proceeds from the EC Remedy related to the Bemis acquisition as compared to the U.S. Remedy in the fiscal year 2019, partially offset by higher capital expenditures\nas a result of the Bemis acquisition.\n        Capital expenditures were $399.5 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $67.3 million compared to $332.2 million for fiscal year 2019. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily\ndue to the increased capital spending following the Bemis acquisition.\n        Cash Flow from Financing Activities\n        Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by $471.5 million, or 61.6%, to $1,236.4 million for fiscal year 2020, from a $764.9 million outflow for fiscal year 2019.

We manage our liquidity risk\ncentrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of our\nbusiness, we aim to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, commercial paper and factoring. The following\nguidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk:\n•\nmaintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;\n•\nregularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing and financing activities;\n•\ngenerally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets;\n•\nmaintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency;\n•\nmanaging credit risk related to financial assets;\n37\n\n\n•\nmonitoring the duration of long-term debt;\n•\nonly investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and\n•\nto the extent practicable, spreading the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities.\n        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $1,976.5 million and $221.2 million, respectively, was drawn under our commercial paper programs.

We expect to continue to fund our long-term business needs on the same basis as in the past, i.e., partially through the cash flow\nprovided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business, in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis.

While the overall impact on our operations to date has not been material, we have\nexperienced volatility in customer order patterns. We have considered the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in our critical accounting estimates and judgements as of June 30, 2020 and\nwill continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact on our business and consolidated results of operations.\nPension Costs\n        Approximately 50% of our defined benefits plans are closed to new entrants and future accruals.

The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends\nperformed by our actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.\n        The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset, in the case of an\noverfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded\nas a component of other comprehensive income. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information\nabout the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date\nrecognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined\nbenefits are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statement of income separately from the service cost component and outside\noperating income.\n        We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond\nyield curve, derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable third-party indexes, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where there is no deep market in corporate\nbonds, we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate. For Mexico, Poland and Turkey, a corporate bond credit spread has been added to the government bond yields. Additionally,\nthe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future long-term return assumption for each individual asset class. A single long-term\nreturn assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plan's target asset allocation.\nPension Assumptions Sensitivity Analysis\n        The following chart depicts the sensitivity of estimated fiscal year 2021 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on assets.\nDiscount Rate\nTotal Increase (Decrease) to\nPension Expense from Current\nAssumption\nRate of Return on Plan Assets\nTotal Increase (Decrease) to\nPension Expense from Current\nAssumption\n(in millions)\n(in millions)\n+25 basis points\n0.1 \n+25 basis points\n(4.2)\n1.96 percent (current assumption)\n— \n3.52 percent (current assumption)\n— \n-25 basis points\n(0.2)\n-25",

Goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested annually or\nwhen events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting\nunit, which is defined as an operating segment, at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit. We have six reporting units, of which five are included in our\nFlexibles Segment. The other reporting unit that is also a reporting segment is Rigid Packaging.\n        Goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during\nthe year. When the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the\nreporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill.\n        In performing our impairment analysis, we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary. If we determine that a quantitative test is necessary, or\nelect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative test, we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using income approaches. The most\n39\n\n\nsignificant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are the estimated net sales and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, discount\nrate and terminal values.\n        Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in\ndetermining fair value amounts, including undiscounted projected future cash flows. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually.\nFactors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings, adverse equity market conditions, and other external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in the need for more frequent\nassessments.\n        Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships, technology, trademarks and software and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,\nwhich range from one to 20 years.

These estimates and projections require judgments as to\nfuture events, conditions, and amounts of future cash flows.\nDeferred Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions\n        We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The determination of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of\nwhether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit, including resolution of\nrelated appeals or litigation processes, if any. The recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. Significant\nestimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit. Additionally, we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax\nassets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we\ndo not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence. Significant judgments and estimates, including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the\nfeasibility of tax planning strategies, are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. If actual results differ from these estimates or there are future\nchanges to tax laws or statutory tax rates, we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of\noperations.\nEquity Accounted Investments\n        Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which we believe we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and cash dividends paid. The\nassessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary and the amount of such other-than-temporary decline requires significant estimates.\n        We review our investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For example, we tested our\ninvestment in AMVIG Holdings Limited (\"AMVIG\") for impairment at March 31, 2020 given that the quoted share price had experienced a significant decline in the month of March associated with\ngeneral market declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the quoted share price did not recover in our fiscal fourth quarter and we determined that the investment was impaired as of June 30, 2020 and recorded an impairment charge of\n$25.6 million. We also recorded impairment charges of our AMVIG investment of $14.0 million in fiscal year 2019 and $36.5 million in fiscal year 2018.\nAcquisitions\n        We record acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the purchase method of accounting. We recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-\ncontrolling interests in an acquired business at their fair values as of the date of acquisition. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred, also measured at fair value, over the\nnet of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets.\n40\n\n\n        We use all available information to estimate fair values and typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination for significant acquisitions. The fair value\nmeasurements are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. Critical estimates in valuing\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected cash flows from customer relationships, acquired developed technology, corporate trade name and brand names; the period of time we expect\nto use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.\n        In estimating the future cash flows, we consider demand, competition, other economic factors and actuarial assumptions for defined benefit plans. We utilize common valuation techniques such\nas discounted cash flows and market approaches, including the relief-from-royalty method to value acquired developed technology, trade names and brand names. Customer relationships are valued\nusing the cost approach or an income approach such as the excess earnings method. We believe our estimates to be based on assumptions that are reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and\nunpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future.\n        In connection with a given business acquisition, we may identify pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition\ncontingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as part of the fair value estimates acquired and liabilities\nassumed and, if so, to determine the estimated amounts.\n        In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of th",

Our overall risk management program seeks to minimize potential adverse effects of these risks on Amcor's financial\nperformance. From time to time, we enter into various derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts, commodity fixed price swaps (on behalf of customers) and interest rate\nswaps to manage these risks. Our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard operating procedures and delegated authorities, which provide guidelines for control,\ncounterparty risk and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the economic risk associated with movements in foreign exchange rates, raw material prices and to fixed\nand variable interest rates, but may not have been designated or qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility. However, we do not trade in\nderivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In addition, we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entity's functional currency to economically\nhedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in our non U.S. subsidiaries, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility.\n        There have been no material changes in the risks described below, other than increased volatility in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, for the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 related to\ninterest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, raw material and commodity price risk and credit risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\n        Our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates and, where appropriate, hedging floating\ninterest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use",

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,\nor disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\nmatter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment - Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America Reporting Units within the Flexibles Segment\nAs described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolid",

Management conducts an impairment\nanalysis in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Management performed a quantitative assessment for\ngoodwill impairment, utilizing present value (discounted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,\nmanagement would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount\nof the carrying value of goodwill. Management’s projected future cash flows for the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units included significant judgments and\nassumptions relating to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting\nunits within the Flexibles Segment is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This in turn led\nto a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s projected future cash flows and significant assumptions, including revenue growth,\nprojected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates.

The Company has a globally diverse operating footprint, selling to customers in\nEurope, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. The Company's sales are widely diversified, with the majority of sales made to the defensive food, beverage,\npharmaceutical, medical device, home and personal care, and other consumer goods end markets. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as to price, innovation, quality and service.\n53\n\n\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S.\nGAAP\").\nBusiness Combinations: The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which requires separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from goodwill, at the acquisition\ndate fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree over the net of the\nacquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company has the ability to\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the three plants in Europe acquired as part of the Bemis acquisition as a discontinued\noperation in fiscal 2019 as the Company agreed to divest of these plants as a condition of approval from the European Commission. See Note 5, \"Discontinued Operations,\" for more information on\ndiscontinued operations. The plants were divested in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nEstimates and Assumptions Required: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\n        These estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions bel",

Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and\nadjusts or revises the estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their impacts cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. In the opinion of\nmanagement, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of the periods presented.\n        The impact that the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic will have on the Company's consolidated operations is uncertain. The Company has considered the potential impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic when developing the Company's estimates and judgements as of June 30, 2020, and will continue to evaluate the extent of the impact on the Company's business and\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company's accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 and the change could be material in future periods.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies: The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries is generally the local currency of such entity.\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies\nother than the entity’s functional currency are remeasured at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date to the entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to\nshort-term and long-term debt are recorded in other non-operating income (loss), net, in the consolidated statement of income. The Company recorded such foreign currency transaction net loss of\n$0.4 million, net gain of $1.1 million and net loss of $82.7 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are\nrecorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of income. These foreign currency transaction net gains amounted to $21.4 million, $8.9 million and $1.0 million during the fiscal years\nended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n        Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the reporting currency of the Company are translated using average exchange rates in effect\nduring each year. Assets and liabilities of operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, while equity balances are\ntranslated at historical rates. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of shareholders’ equity.\nHighly Inflationary Accounting: A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a thre",

If a\ncountry's economy is classified as highly inflationary, the financial statements of the foreign entity operating in that country must be remeasured to the functional currency of the parent. As of July 1,\n2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso as the functional currency for the Company's\nsubsidiaries in Argentina. The impact of\n54\n\n\nhighly inflationary accounting was $27.7 million and $30.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the consolidated statement of income.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue by providing its customers with flexible and rigid packaging serving a variety of markets including food, consumer products and healthcare\nend markets. The Company enters into a variety of agreements with customers, including quality agreements, pricing agreements and master supply agreements which outline the terms under which\nthe Company does business with a specific customer. The Company also sells to some customers solely based on purchase orders. The Company has concluded for the vast majority of its revenues,\nthat its contracts with customers are either a purchase order or the combination of a purchase order with a master supply agreement. All revenue recognized in the consolidated statement of income is\nconsidered to be revenue from contracts with customers.\n        The Company typically satisfies the obligation to provide packaging to customers at a point in time upon shipment when control is transferred to customers. Revenue is recognized net of\nallowances for returns and customer claims and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The Company does not have any material contract\nassets or contract liabilities. The Company disaggregates revenue based on geography. Disaggregation of revenue is presented in Note 20, \"Segments\".\nSignificant Judgments\n        Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. The\nCompany identified potential performance obligations in its customer master supply agreements and determined that none of them are capable of being distinct as the customer can only benefit from\nthe supplied packaging. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it has one performance obligation to supply packaging to customers.\n        The Company may provide variable consideration in several forms which are determined through its agreements with customers. The Company can offer prompt payment discounts, sales rebates\nor other incentive payments to customers. Sales rebates and other incentive payments are typically awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, including volume.

The Company utilizes forecasted sales data and rebate percentages specific to each customer agreement and updates its\njudgment of the amounts to which the customer is entitled each period.\n        The Company enters into long term agreements with certain customers, under which it is obligated to make various up-front payments for which it expects to receive a benefit in excess of the\ncost over the term of the contract. These up-front payments are deferred and reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets on its consolidated balance sheet.\nContract incentives are typically recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement.\nPractical Expedients\n        The Company sells primarily through its direct sales force. Any external sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. External sales\ncommission expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income.\n        The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs. Accordingly, shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of products sold while amounts\nbilled to customers are classified as a component of net sales.\n        The Company excluded from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing\ntransaction and collected from the customer, including sales taxes, value added taxes, excise taxes and use taxes. Accordingly, the tax amounts are not included in net sales.\n        The Company does not adjust the promised consideration for the time value of money for contracts where the difference between the time of payment and performance is one year or less.\nResearch and Development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.\nRestructuring Costs: Restructuring costs are recognized when the liability is incurred. The Company calculates severance obligations based on its standard customary practices. Accordingly, the\nCompany records provisions for severance when probable and estimable and the Company has committed to the restructuring plan. In the absence of a standard customary\n55\n\n\npractice or established local practice, liabilities for severance are recognized when incurred. If fixed assets are to be disposed of as a result of the Company’s restructuring efforts, the assets are written\noff when the Company commits to dispose of them and they are no longer in use. Depreciation is accelerated on fixed assets for the period of time the asset continues to be used until the asset ceases\nto be used. Other restructuring costs, including costs to relocate equipment, are generally recorded as the cost is incurred or the service is provided.

Cash equivalents\ninclude certificates of deposit that can be readily liquidated without penalty at the Company’s option. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair market value.\nTrade Receivables, Net: Trade accounts receivable, net, are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for sales returns and the estimated losses resulting from\nthe inability of its customers to make required payments. When determining the collectability of specific customer accounts, a number of factors are evaluated, including: customer creditworthiness,\npast transaction history with the customer and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection experience, current economic industry trends and a review of\nthe current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when determining the required allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts of $35.3 million\nand $34.4 million recorded at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in trade receivables, net, on the consolidated balance sheet. The current year expense to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts\nis recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income.\n        The Company enters into factoring arrangements from time to time to sell trade receivables to third-party financial institutions. Sales of receivables are accounted for in accordance with\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing (\"ASC 860\"). Agreements which result in true sales of the\ntransferred receivables, as defined in ASC 860, which occur when receivables are transferred without recourse to the Company, are reflected as a reduction of trade receivables, net on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Agreements that allow the Company to maintain\neffective control over the transferred receivables and which do not qualify as a true sale, as defined in ASC 860, are accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance\nsheets within trade receivables, net and short-term debt. The expenses associated with receivables factoring are recorded in the consolidated statement of income primarily as a reduction of net sales.\nFactored receivables not qualifying as a true sale were accounted for as secured borrowings.

The Company\nreevaluates its leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising lease renewal options. Short term leases with a term of twelve months or less, including\nreasonably certain holding periods, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. As the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing\nrate as of the commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The Company recognizes expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the\nconsolidated statement of income. Certain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary for other reasons. Variable lease payments that do not\ndepend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability and recognized as expense in the period in which the obligation for the\npayments occur.\nGoodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested annually or whenever events and\ncircumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are a reporting unit’s operating results significantly declining\nrelative to its operating plan or historical performance, and competitive pressures and changes in the general markets in which it operates. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global\nimpacts, the Company considered the potential for goodwill impairment of its reporting units in the third fiscal quarter of 2020. The review did not indicate an impairment triggering event as of\nMarch 31, 2020.\n        All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as the operating segment. In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company reassessed its segment reporting structure in\nthe first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexibles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America. With this change, the Company has\nsix reporting units with goodwill that are assessed for potential impairment.\n        In performing the required impairment tests, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill\nimpairment. If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed.

If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, or if market factors outside of Amcor’s control, such as factors\nimpacting the applicable discount rate, or economic or political conditions in key markets, change significantly, then goodwill allocated to one or more reporting units may be impaired.\n        The Company performs its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year.\n        A quantitative impairment analysis was performed in the fourth fiscal quarter for all reporting units for the fiscal years ended 2020 and 2018, while a qualitative analysis was performed for the\nfiscal year ended 2019. The Company’s annual impairment analysis for all three fiscal years concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The Company’s quantitative goodwill analysis in fiscal years\n2020 and 2018 concluded that the fair values substantially exceeded the carrying amounts for each reporting unit.\n        Although no reporting units failed the assessments noted above in the annual impairment analysis for 2020, during the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at June 30, 2020, the\nCompany considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting\nunits may have been impaired. It is management's opinion that no such events have occurred.\nOther Intangible Assets, Net: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized against income using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,\nwith original periods ranging from one to 20 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the\namount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate carrying value\nmay not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.\n        Costs incurred to develop software programs to be used solely to meet the Company's internal needs have been capitalized as computer software within other intangible assets.\nFair Value Measurements: The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).

The Company believes that the accounting estimates related to its pension plans are critical accounting estimates because they are highly susceptible to\nchange from period to period based on the performance of plan assets, actuarial valuations, market conditions and contracted benefit changes.

Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize the investor’s share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of\nacquisition and is adjusted for impairment whenever it is determined that a decline in the fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary.

Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets\nand liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported\nin the consolidated financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities.\n        Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that\nany portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed adjustments from\nvarious tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions.\nAccounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax\nreturn.

The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of\nrestructuring and related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses,\n$25 million in fixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. The Company estimates that approximately $150 million of the $200\nmillion total integration costs will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of\nwhich $54.1 million were payments related to restructuring and related expenditures. The 2019 Bemis Integration Plan relates to the Flexibles segment and Corporate and is expected to be completed\nby the end of fiscal year 2022.\n        Restructuring related costs are directly attributable to restructuring activities; however, they do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities. General integration costs\nare not linked to restructuring. The Company believes the disclosure of restructuring related costs provides more information on the total cost of our 2019 Bemis Integration Plan.

The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash\nimpairments.

This initiative\nwas designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the\ncost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market.\n        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, the Company has closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. The Company's total pre-tax restructuring\ncosts were $230.8 million, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to\ndismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million total costs resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4\nmillion.

The fair values of these assets are determined, when applicable, based on valuation techniques using the best information available, and\nmay include quoted market prices, market comparables and discounted cash flow projections.\n        The Company tests for impairment of its equity method investments when impairment indicators are present. Impairment tests were performed by comparing the carrying value of the\nCompany’s investment in AMVIG at the end of each\n73\n\n\nperiod, including interim periods, to the fair value of the investment, which was determined based on AMVIG's quoted share price which is classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.\n        Based on the Company’s evaluation of AMVIG’s current financial condition and the Company’s intent and ability to hold its investment in AMVIG to recover the carrying value, the Company\nconcluded that the decline in fair value was temporary at March 31, 2020, and therefore no impairment was recorded. However, the quoted share price did not recover in the fiscal fourth quarter and\nthe Company determined that the investment was impaired as of June 30, 2020 and recorded an impairment charge of $25.6 million. The Company also recorded impairment charges of our AMVIG\ninvestment of $14.0 million in fiscal year 2019 and $36.5 million in fiscal year 2018.\n        The Company tests indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. The\nCompany recognized non-cash impairment charges of $31.1 million in the fiscal year 2019 to reduce the carrying value of an indefinite-lived technology intangible asset to its fair value. During fiscal\nyear 2020 and 2018, there were no indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges recorded.\n74\n\n\nNote 11 - Derivative Instruments\n        The Company periodically uses derivatives and other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rates, commodity and currency risks.

On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses and documents that its hedges have been and are expected to continue to be highly effective.\nInterest Rate Risk\n        The Company's policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates and, where appropriate, hedging\nfloating interest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, and\ninterest rate locks.\n        For interest rate swaps that are accounted for as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of both the hedging instruments and the underlying debt obligations are immediately recognized in\ninterest expense. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of income under other\nnon-operating income (loss), net.\n        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of the Company's receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was $837.1 million and $841.1 million, respectively.\n        At June 30, 2020, the Company had a notional amount of $100 million (equivalent to €89.0 million) cross-currency interest rate swaps outstanding. The Company did not designate the swaps as\na hedging instrument and thus changes in fair value were immediately recognized in earnings.\n        During the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into six Treasury lock agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to the highly probable issuance of\nlong-term debt. The total notional amount of the Treasury lock of $250.0 million was designated as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction and deemed these agreements to be highly\neffective.\n        The associated unsecured senior note was issued on June 19, 2020, and the Company has settled these Treasury lock agreements with a $19.8 million cash payment to the counterparties. The loss\nassociated with the settlement was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the unsecured senior notes, which is 10 years.\nForeign Currency Risk\n        The Company manufactures and sells its products and finances operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange\nrates. The purpose of the Company's foreign currency hedging program is to manage the volatility associated with the changes in exchange rates.\n        To manage this exchange rate risk, the Company utilizes forward contracts.

The Company's valuation allowance increased by $72.9 million, increased by $20.4 million and increased by $5.3 million for fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe increase of the Company’s valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributed to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset arising from Swiss tax reform.\n        The decrease in deferred tax liability related to undistributed foreign earnings in fiscal year 2020 includes the tax impact of the EC Remedy sale of $82.5 million.\n        As of June 30, 2020, the Company has UK net operating losses (tax effected) and tax credits of approximately $2.9 million that do not expire. The Company has non-UK net operating losses (tax\neffected) and other tax attribute carryforwards of $50.9 million, the majority of which do not expire. The Company recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets associated with these net\noperating losses and tax credits. The benefits of these carryforwards are dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which they arose.\n        The Company considers the following factors, among others, in evaluating its plans for indefinite reinvestment of its subsidiaries' earnings: (i) the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements\nof the Company and its subsidiaries, both for the long term and for the short term; and (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to reinvest earnings of any subsidiary. The Company has not provided\ndeferred taxes on approximately $968.2 million of earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. Upon distribution of such\nearnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to incremental foreign tax. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of\n95\n\n\nforeign tax that might be payable. A cumulative deferred tax liability of $26.9 million has been recorded attributable to undistributed earnings that the Company has deemed are no longer indefinitely\nreinvested. The remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's subsidiaries are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested and can be repatriated at no tax cost. Accordingly, there is no provision\nfor income or withholding taxes on these earnings.\n        The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, \"Income Taxes.\" At June 30, 2020 and 2019, unrecognized tax benefits totaled $101.1 million and $102.6\nmillion, respectively, all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized.\n        The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

The Company will vigorously\ndefend its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's\nconsolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to\nany administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the\nliquidity of Amcor. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded an accrual of $11.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated\nbalance sheet and has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $18.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties\nand the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of\nthe ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these\nmatters may differ from the Company's estimates.\n        As of June 30, 2020, the Company provided letters of credit of $34.0 million, judicial insurance of $0.9 million and deposited cash of $10.1 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases\nreferenced above.\nContingencies - Environmental Matters\n        The Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") at several waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and\nregulations and may face potentially material environmental remediation obligations. While the Company benefits from various forms of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or only partially,\ncover the total potential exposures. The Company has recorded $17.1 million aggregate accruals for its share of estimated future remediation costs as these sites.\n        In addition to the matters described above, the Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of $46.6 million for potential liabilities for remediation obligations at various worldwide locations\nthat are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated.\n        While the Company believes that its accruals are adequate to cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultim",

On June 24, 2019, the Burford funds sent a formal written demand for payment of the fair value of the funds’ shares. On September 6,\n2019, the Burford funds filed a Petition for Appraisal of Stock in the Missouri court. On November 4, 2019, Bemis filed an Answer to the Petition for Appraisal of Stock. On June 24, 2020, the\nparties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release of all claims and two days later the case was dismissed with prejudice.\n        Two lawsuits brought by purported holders of Bemis stock against Bemis and Bemis directors and officers are pending in federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, in which plaintiffs are seeking damages for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.\nPlaintiffs allege a failure to disclose adequately information in the proxy statement issued in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merger. The cases are: Dixon, et al. v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al. and\nStein v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al., which were instituted on April 15, 2019 and April 17, 2019, respectively. On March 10, 2020 the federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District\nof New York consolidated the two pending cases into a single class action.\n102\n\n\n        In addition, a purported holder of Bemis stock filed a putative derivative suit in the Cole County Circuit Court, Nineteenth Judicial District of Missouri, against Bemis directors and Amcor,\nalleging that the directors breached fiduciary duties in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merger and that Amcor aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duty. The case is Scarantino, et al. v. Amcor\nLimited, et al., which was instituted on April 19, 2019.\n        The Company intends to defend the claims made in the pending actions. It is too early for the Company to provide any reliable assessment of the likely quantum of any damages that may\nbecome payable if its defense is unsuccessful in whole or in part.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company reassessed its segment reporting\nstructure in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexibles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America. The five Flexibles\noperating segments (Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa; Flexibles North America, Flexibles Latin America; Flexibles Asia Pacific and Specialty Cartons) have been aggregated in the Flexibles\nreporting segment as they exhibit similarity in economic characteristics and future prospects, similarity in the products they offer, their production technologies, the customers they serve, the nature of\ntheir service delivery models, and their regulatory environments.\n        In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company changed its measure of segment performance from adjusted operating income to adjusted\nearnings before interest and tax (\"Adjusted EBIT\") from continuing operations.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal\nexecutive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Accordingly, even\neffective internal controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n        As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end reporting process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were\nappropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information. This control deficiency did not result in a misstatement of our consolidated financial\nstatements.

Given we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in\nfiscal 2021. These enhanced processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered\nremediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, they are designed and operating effectively. We currently expect that the\nremediation of this material weakness will be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. However, there is no assurance that the material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of fiscal 2021 as the\nseverity and length of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic is unknown and the remediation timeline could be negatively impacted because of inefficiencies caused by COVID-19\nlimitations on travel, meetings and on-site work.\nCompleted Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness\n        As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness related to a lack of experience in\ntechnical accounting in U.S. GAAP and U.S. domestic registrant filing requirements. Since the material weakness has been identified, we have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes\nand to remediate the material weakness. We have hired additional financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP technical accounting and financial reporting experience, as well as U.S. domestic\nregistrant filing experience, aligned our accounting policies and procedures with U.S. GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process with U.S. GAAP experienced\nstaff, and have conducted technical training for accounting and finance personnel. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented\nsteps and found them to be effective.

Each of Amcor’s securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act are listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). CHESS Depositary Interests (“CDI’s”) representing our ordinary shares are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”).\nDESCRIPTION OF ORDINARY SHARES\nThe following is a summary of the material terms of our ordinary shares as set forth in our Articles of Association and the material provisions of the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. This summary\ndoes not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of Association, which are filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.26\nis a part.\nShare Capital\nThe authorized share capital of Amcor is $100,000,000, divided into 9,000,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.01 par value each and 1,000,000,000 preferred shares of $0.01 par value each, which may be\nissued in such class or classes or series as the our board of directors (“board”) may determine in accordance with our Articles of Association. As of August 25, 2020, we had 1,568,481,519 ordinary\nshares issued and outstanding.\nAll ordinary shares have equal voting rights and no right to a fixed income and carry the right to receive dividends that have been declared by Amcor. The holders of ordinary shares have the right to\nreceive notice of, and to attend and vote at, all general meetings of Amcor. The rights and obligations attaching to any preferred shares will be determined at the time of issue by our board in its\nabsolute discretion and must be set forth in a statement of rights. Any preferred shares that are issued may have priority over the ordinary shares with respect to dividend or liquidation rights or both.\nWe do not have any preferred shares issued and outstanding.\nOur board may issue ordinary shares or preferred shares without further shareholder action, unless shareholder action is required by applicable law or by the rules of the NYSE, ASX or other stock\nexchange or quotation system on which any class or series of our ordinary shares may be listed or quoted.\nSubject to our Articles of Association and the rights or restrictions attached to any shares or class of shares, if Amcor is wound up and the property of Amcor available for distribution among the\nshareholders is more than suf",

If Amcor is wound up, the directors or liquidator (as applicable) may, with the\nsanction of a special resolution of the shareholders of Amcor and any other sanction required by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (the “Jersey Companies Law”), divide among the shareholders the\nwhole or any part of the assets of Amcor and determine how the division will be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders.\nCDIs are units of beneficial ownership in shares constituted under Australian law which may be held and transferred through the CHESS system. For further information regarding the CDIs, see \"—\nCHESS Depositary Interests\" below.

An ordinary resolution requires approval by the holders of a majority of the voting rights\nrepresented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting thereon. A special resolution requires approval by the holders of two-thirds of the voting rights represented at a meeting, in person or by\nproxy, and voting thereon (or such greater majority as the Articles of Association may prescribe).\nVoting rights with respect to any class of preferred shares (if any) will be determined by our board and set out in the relevant statement of rights for such class.\nNeither Jersey law nor the Articles of Association restrict non-resident shareholders from holding or exercising voting rights in relation of our ordinary shares. There are no provisions in the Jersey\nCompanies Law relating to cumulative voting.\nNo Preemptive Rights\nAmcor shareholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire newly issued ordinary shares.\nVariation of Rights\nThe rights attached to any class of ordinary shares, such as voting, dividends and the like, may, unless their terms of issue state otherwise, be varied by a special resolution passed at a separate\nmeeting of the holders of shares of such class.\nCertificated and Uncertificated Shares\nOrdinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. Every holder of certificated shares is entitled, without payment, to have a certificate for the shares that it owns executed under\nAmcor",

Our board may rescind a decision to pay a dividend if it decides, before the payment date, that Amcor's financial\nposition no longer justifies the payment. The payment of a dividend does not require shareholder confirmation or approval at a general meeting of the shareholders.\nHolders of our ordinary shares are entitled to receive equally, on a per share basis, any dividends that may be declared in respect of ordinary shares by our board.\nOur board may direct that a dividend will be satisfied from any available source permitted by law, including wholly or partly by the distribution of assets, including paid up shares or securities of\nanother company. If Amcor declares cash dividends, such dividends will be declared in U.S. dollars.\nUnder the Jersey Companies Law, dividends may be paid from any source permitted by law (other than from nominal capital account and capital redemption reserve), subject to a requirement for the\ndirectors who are to authorize the payment of any dividend to make a statutory solvency statement.\nOur Articles of Association permit our board to require that all dividend payments will be paid only through electronic transfer into an account selected by the shareholder rather than by a bank\ncheck.\nNo dividend or other monies payable on or in respect of a share will bear interest as against Amcor (unless the terms of the share specify otherwise).\nIf any dividend is unclaimed for 11 calendar months after issuance, our board may stop payment on the dividend or otherwise make use of the unclaimed amount for the benefit of Amcor until\nclaimed or otherwise disposed of according to the laws relating to unclaimed monies.\n\n\nAlteration of Share Capital\nUnder the Jersey Companies Law, Amcor may, by special resolution of its shareholders: increase its share capital; consolidate and sub-divide; convert shares into or from stock; re-denominate any of\nits shares into another currency or reduce its share capital, capital redemption reserve or share premium account in any way.\nRedeemable Shares\nOur ordinary shares will not initially be redeemable. Pursuant to the Jersey Companies Law and our Articles of Association, our board may issue redeemable shares or convert existing non-\nredeemable shares, whether issued or not, into redeemable shares, which shares will be, in each case, redeemable in accordance with their terms or at the option of Amcor and/or at the option of the\nholder (provided that an issued non-redeemable share may only be converted into a redeemable share with the agreement of the holder or pur",

If the purchase is to be made on a stock exchange, the special resolution\nmust specify the maximum number of shares or CDIs to be purchased, the maximum and minimum prices which may be paid, and the date on which the authority to purchase is to expire (which may\nnot be more than five years after the date of the resolution). If the purchase is to be made otherwise than on a stock exchange, the purchase must be made pursuant to a written purchase contract\napproved in advance by a resolution of shareholders (excluding the shareholder from whom Amcor proposes to purchase shares or CDIs).\nShareholder Meetings\nAnnual Meetings of Shareholders\nUnder Jersey law, Amcor must hold an annual general meeting once every calendar year and not more than 18 months may elapse between two successive annual general meetings, at such date, time\nand place as may be determined by our Board.\nA general shareholder meeting may only be called by a resolution of the board or as otherwise provided in the Jersey Companies Law.\nSpecial Meetings of Shareholders\nThe board may, and upon request of shareholders as required by Jersey law (and as described below) must, convene an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders.\nUnder the Jersey Companies Law, shareholders of Amcor holding 10% or more of the company's voting rights and entitled to vote at the relevant meeting may legally require the directors to call a\nmeeting of shareholders. Upon receiving a requisition notice from shareholders, the board must call a special meeting as soon as practicable but in any case not later than two months after the date of\nthe requisition. If the directors do not within 21 days from the date of the deposit of the requisition proceed to call a meeting to be held within two months of that date, the requisitionists, or any of\nthem representing more than half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves call a meeting, but a meeting so called may not be held after three months from that date.\nNotice of Meetings; Record Date\nUnder the Articles of Association and applicable stock exchange listing rules, the notice for a general meeting must be sent to all shareholders. The content of a notice of a general meeting called by\nthe board is to be decided by the board, but it must designate the meeting as an annual or extraordinary general meeting and must state the general nature of the business to be transacted at the\nmeeting and any other matters required by the Jersey Companies Law.\n\n\nFor the purpose of determining whether a person is entitled as a shareholder to attend or vote at a meeting and how many votes s",

Amcor may specify a separate time by which a CDI holder must be on the CDI register in order to direct the Depositary Nominee (as defined herein) to vote or appoint a proxy.\nQuorum\nUnder the Articles of Association, no business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum (the holders of shares representing at least the majority of total voting rights of all\nshareholders entitled to vote at such meeting) is present in person or by proxy at the time when the meeting proceeds to business.\nAction by Written Consent\nThe Articles of Association prohibit actions to be taken by unanimous written consent.

Ordinary shares are not traded on the financial market operated by the ASX. This is because ASX's electronic settlement system,\nknown as CHESS, cannot be used directly for the transfer of securities of issuers, such as Amcor, incorporated in countries whose laws do not recognize CHESS as a system to record uncertificated\nholdings or to electronically transfer legal title. CDIs have been created to facilitate electronic settlement and transfer in Australia for companies in this situation.\nCDIs are a type of depositary receipt which provide the holder with ultimate beneficial ownership of the underlying ordinary shares of Amcor.

However, there are a number of differences between holding CDIs and ordinary shares. The major differences are that:\n•\nCDI holders do not have legal title in the underlying ordinary shares to which the CDIs relate (the chain of title in the ordinary shares underlying the CDIs is summarized above);\n•\nCDI holders are not able to vote personally as shareholders at a meeting of Amcor. Instead, CDI holders are provided with a voting instruction form which will enable them to instruct the\nDepositary Nominee in relation to the exercise of voting rights. In addition, a CDI holder is able to request the Depositary Nominee to appoint the CDI holder or a third party nominated by\nthe CDI holder as its proxy so that the proxy so appointed may exercise the votes attaching to the ordinary shares; and\n•\nCDI holders will not be directly entitled to certain other rights conferred on holders of ordinary shares, including the right to apply to a Jersey court for an order on the grounds that the affairs\nof Amcor are being conducted in a manner which is unfairly prejudicial to the interests of Amcor shareholders; and the right to apply to the Jersey Financial Services Commission to have an\ninspector appointed to investigate the affairs of Amcor.\nAlternatively, CDI holders can convert their CDIs into Amcor ordinary shares in sufficient time before the relevant meeting, in which case they will be able to vote personally as shareholders of\nAmcor.\nApplication of Standard Table\nThe \"standard table\" of provisions under the Jersey Companies Law does not apply.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES\nThe following description of the 1.125% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “Notes”) issued by Amcor UK Finance plc, a subsidiary of Amcor (the “Issuer”) summarizes certain material terms of the Notes.\nThis description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the indenture, which is filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.26 is a part.\nThe Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of June 23, 2020 among the Issuer, Amcor, AFUI, Amcor Pty Ltd and Bemis, as guarantors, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as\ntrustee (the \"Trustee\"), as supplemented by an officer's certificate, dated as of June 23, 2020.

The Employer may, in its sole discretion, chose to make a contribution in any Plan Year for some or all Participants of less than the full amount necessary to make up the Pension Plan benefits due to items (i) through (iii) above. The following provisions and assumptions shall govern the determination of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions: (a) For purposes of determining the amount of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions each Plan Year, the Employer shall assume that the Participant will terminate employment and begin receiving benefits from the Pension Plan at the later of age 60 or the Participant’s attainment of five years of service (as defined in the Pension Plan), which benefits shall be assumed to be reduced for early commencement unless the Participant has attained age 65 and completed 5 years of service. If a Participant terminates employment after age 55 and completion of 5 years of service but prior to age 60, the Participant will receive a lesser amount of Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions than if the Participant had remained employed until age 60. If a Participant who is eligible for Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions remains employed by -9-\n\n\n \nan Employer until age 60 and completion of 5 years of service, the Participant will continue to receive Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions past such date to account for the Participant’s service after such date. (b) For purposes of determining the amount of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contribution each Plan Year, the Employer will base contributions on Compensation, the GAM 94 mortality table, and assumed Compensation increases of inflation plus 1.5%, provided that all actuarial assumptions may vary as the Committee determines advisable. The Employer will hypothetically assume that prior Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions on behalf of such Participant will increase at an earnings rate specified by the Committee, which as of January 1, 2005 equals the average of the 10-year Treasury US government securities plus 2%, notwithstanding the fact that the Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions will be invested in the investment funds selected by the Participant in accordance with subsection 6.2 of the Plan. (c) Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions for eligible Participants will be fully funded by the Employer at the later of: (i) the Participant’s attainment of age 60, or (ii) the Participant’s completion of five years of service (as defined under the Pension Plan). However, if a Participant continues employment after age 60, the Committee shall determine the procedures for future funding of such Participant’s benefit. 4.6 Employer Special Contributions The Employer may, in its sole discretion, make an additional Employer Special Contribution in any Plan Year to Eligible Employees in an",

The most relevant figures for net trade receivables are from Chunk ID 57 ($1,615.9 million) and Chunk ID 111 ($787.2 million). These are explicitly labeled as \"Trade receivables, net.\"\n\nThere is a discrepancy between these two figures, and without additional context or clarification, it is challenging to determine which one accurately represents the net AR for FY2020. The citations do not provide enough context to resolve this conflict definitively.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to determine which of these figures is the correct representation of Amcor's net AR for FY2020. Additional context from the balance sheet or notes to the financial statements would be necessary to resolve this discrepancy and confirm the correct figure. If we had to choose based on the available data, we would prioritize the figure with the most direct and clear citation related to \"Trade receivables, net,\" which is $1,615.9 million from Chunk ID 57. However, this decision is tentative without further corroboration."

Under the terms of the Agreement, Bemis shareholders received 5.1 Amcor shares for each share of Bemis stock and Amcor\nshareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument (\"CDI\") for each share of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction, the Amcor shares were\nregistered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"AMCR\" and the CDI's representing our shares on the\nAustralian Securities Exchange (\"ASX\") are traded under the symbol \"AMC.\" In addition, Amcor Limited shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares were delisted ",

To fulfill our aspiration, we are\ndetermined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment.\nFocused portfolio\n        Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics:\n•\nA focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,\n•\ngood industry structure,\n•\nattractive relative growth, and\n•\nmultiple paths for us to win from our leadership position, scale and other competitive advantages.\n        These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.\nDifferentiated capabilities\n        \"The Amcor Way\" describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership,\nInnovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline.\nShareholder value creation\n        Through our portfolio of focused business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value. The defensive nature of\nour end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time value creation has been strong and consistent through paying dividends\nand growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets and pursuing targeted acquisitions or by returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks.\n6\n\n\nSegment Information\n        Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 280, \"Segment Reporting,\" establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set\nforth in ASC 280, the Company has determined it has two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reporting segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons,\nand closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to\nNote 20, \"Segments,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about reporting segments.\nFlexibles Segment\n        The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 40,000 employees at 181 principal manufacturing facilities in 39 countries as of June 30, 2020, the\nFlexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2020, Flexibles accounted for approximately 78% of the Company’s\nconsolidated net sales.\nRigid Packaging Segment\n        The Rigid Packaging Segment manufacturers rigid packaging containers and related products in the Ameri",

In fiscal year 2020, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 22% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.\nMarketing, Distribution, and Competition\n        Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America,\nAfrica and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design\ntechnicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization.\n        We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2020. Sales to PepsiCo, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11.1% and 11.0%\nof our sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. Business arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these\nbusiness arrangements would typically occur over a period of time.\n         The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive.

We have a\nnumber of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in other countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks\ncollectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as a whole or those of our\nreporting segments. Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise.\nSustainability, Innovation and Environmental Laws and Regulations\n        We believe there will always be a role for the primary packages made by Amcor. Packaging protects and preserves food and healthcare products, and reduces the carbon footprint and waste of\nproducts. It extends shelf life and reduces food\nand other product loss across a range of distribution channels. Consumers want cost effective, convenient and easy to use packaging which also has an end of life solution to reduce waste. We believe\nresponsible packaging is the answer to achieve less waste through innovative packaging design, waste management infrastructure and consumer participation.\n        Amcor is committed to responsible packaging and we see this as being integral to our success. In January 2018, we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our\npackaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world.\n        We are highly regarded for our innovation capabilities and we have thousands of active patents. We collaborate with customers, suppliers, and innovators to create industry-leading solutions, and\nwith stakeholders to increase available infrastructure for waste collection, sorting and recycling and to inform consumers about the environmental implications of their packaging. We are uniquely\npositioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging. Addressing the need for and increasing the supply of responsible packaging is one of the\nmost important growth opportunities for Amcor.\n        Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions.

Consequently, changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that\nwe serve or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns and perceptions, may result\nin a decline in the demand for certain of our products or the obsolescence of some of our existing products. Although we have adopted certain strategies designed to mitigate the impact of declining\nsales, there is no guarantee that such strategies will be successful or will offset a decline in demand. Furthermore, any new products that we produce may not meet sales or margin expectations due to\nmany factors, including our inability to accurately predict customer demand, end user preferences or movements in industry standards or to develop products that meet consumer demand in a timely\nand cost-effective manner.\n        Changing preferences for products and packaging formats may result in increased demand for other products we produce. However, to the extent changing preferences are not offset by demand\nfor new or alternative products, changes to consumer preferences ",

From time to time, a\nsingle customer, depending on the current status and volumes of a number of separate contracts in disparate locations, may account for 10% or more of our revenue. Sales to our largest customer\naccounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales for fiscal years 2019 and 2018. We did not have sales to a single customer that exceeded 10% of our net sales in 2020 or sales to any other\ncustomer that accounted for more than 10% of net sales in these fiscal periods.\n        Customer concentration can be even more pronounced within certain business units. Consequently, the loss of any of our key customers or any significant reduction in their production\nrequirements, or an adverse change in the terms of our supply agreements with them, could reduce our sales revenue and net profit.\n        There can be no guarantee that our key customers will not in the future seek to source some or all of their products or services from competitors, change to alternative forms of packaging, begin\nmanufacturing their packaging products in-house or seek to renew their business with us on terms less favorable than before.\n        Any loss, change or other adverse event related to our key customer relationships could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations, which\neffect may be material.\n        In addition, over recent years certain of our customers have acquired companies with similar or complementary product lines. This consolidation has increased the concentration of our business\nwith these customers. Such consolidation may be accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices, reflecting the increase in the total volume of products purchased or the elimination of a\nprice differential between the acquiring customer and the company acquired. While we have generally been successful at managing customer consolidations, increased pricing pressures from our\ncustomers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nCompetition — We face significant competition in the industries and regions in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business.\n        We operate in highly competitive geographies and end use areas, each with varying barriers to entry, industry structures and competitive behavior.

No assurance can be given that the actions of\nestablished or potential competitors will not have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our plans and on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nExpanding Our Current Business — We may be unable to expand our current business effectively through either organic growth, including product innovation, or acquisitions.\n        Our business strategy includes both organic expansion of our existing operations, particularly through efforts to strengthen and expand relationships with customers in emerging markets, product\ninnovation, and expansion through acquisitions. However, we may not be able to execute our strategy effectively for reasons within and outside our control. Our ability to grow organically may be\nlimited by, among other things, extensive saturation in the locations in which we operate or a change or reduction in our customers’ growth plans due to changing economic conditions, strategic\npriorities or otherwise. For many of our businesses, organic growth depends on product innovation, new product development and timely responses to changing consumer demands and preferences.\nConsequently, failure to develop new or improved products in response to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner may hinder our growth potential, affect our competitive position and\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\n        Additionally, over the past decade, we have pursued growth through acquisitions, including our acquisition of Bemis in 2019. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable\nacquisition targets in the right geographic regions and with the right participation strategy in the future, or to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms or at all. Other companies in the\nindustries and regions in which we operate have similar investment and acquisition strategies to us, resulting in competition for a limited pool of potential acquisition targets. Due in part to that\ncompetition, as well as the recent low interest rate environment, which has made debt funding more appealing and accessible, price multiples for potential targets are currently higher than their\nhistorical averages.

In addition, the process of integrating operations could result in an interruption of normal business operations.\n        We generally expect that we will realize synergy cost savings and other financial and operating benefits from our acquisitions. For example, we expect the Bemis acquisition in 2019 will\ngenerate estimated pre-tax annual net cost synergies by the end of the third year of approximately $180 million from procurement, manufacturing and general and administrative efficiencies. While\nwe are currently on track to achieve the targeted Bemis synergies, we cannot predict with certainty that the full savings will be realized or current savings will be sustained.

As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, governmental authorities have implemented and are continuing to implement numerous and constantly evolving measures to try to contain the\nvirus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on gatherings, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business shutdowns. Measures providing for business shutdowns generally exclude\nessential services and the critical infrastructure supporting the essential services. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing\nessential services. However, we have experienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of our fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand\nfor our products in the future. We have also impaired an equity method investment by $25.6 million in the fourth quarter, in part, partially due to general market declines associated with the\npandemic.

The coronavirus may result in a prolonged economic downturn,\nsuch as increased unemployment, decreases in capital spending, business shutdowns, or economic recessions, which could negatively affect demand for our customers’ products. Despite our efforts to\nmanage these impacts, the extent to which the coronavirus or other outbreaks impact our business and operations, including our ability to secure financing at attractive rates, is unknown and the effect\ncould be material.\nGlobal Operations — Challenging current and future global economic conditions have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business operations and financial results.\n        Demand for our products and services is dependent on consumer demand for our packaging products, including packaged food, beverage, healthcare, personal care, agribusiness, industrial, and\nother consumer goods. As a result, general economic downturns in our key geographic regions and globally can adversely affect our business operations and financial results. The current global\neconomic challenges, including relatively high levels of unemployment in certain areas in which we operate, low economic growth and difficulties associated with managing rising debt levels and\nrelated economic volatility in certain economies, are likely to continue to put pressure on the global economy and our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility in world economies.\n        When challenging economic conditions exist, our customers may delay, decrease or cancel purchases from us, and may also delay payment or fail to pay us altogether.

Accordingly, additional charges could be incurred that would have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position, which may be material.\nLabor disputes — We are subject to the risk of labor disputes, which could adversely affect our business.\n        Although we have not experienced any significant labor disputes in recent years, there can be no assurance that we will not experience labor disputes in the future, including protests and strikes,\nwhich could disrupt our business operations and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operation. Although we consider our relations with our employees to be good, there can be no\nassurance that we will be able to maintain a satisfactory working relationship with our employees in the future.\n15\n\n\nFinancial Risks\nLIBOR Indexed Borrowings — The expected phase out of LIBOR could impact the interest rates paid on our variable rate indebtedness and cause our interest expense to increase.\n        A substantial portion of our borrowing capacity bears interest at a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). In July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct\nAuthority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates\nCommittee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"), a new index calculated by\nshort-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities.\n        Certain of our financing agreements include language to determine a replacement rate for LIBOR, if necessary. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate some financing\nagreements extending beyond 2021 that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest\nrate, however, we are not able to predict whether LIBOR will cease to be available after 2021, whether SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR, or what the impact of\nsuch a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nExchange Rates — We are exposed to foreign exchange rate risk.\n        We are subject to foreign exchange rate risk, both transactional and translational, which may negatively affect our financial performance. Transactional foreign exchange exposures result from\nexchange rate fluctuations, including in respect of the U.S. dollar, the Euro, and other currencies, including in Latin America, in which our costs are denominated, which may affect our business input\ncosts and proceeds from product sales.

In particular, our translational exposure may be impacted by movements in the\nexchange rate between the Euro and the Brazilian Real against the U.S. dollar. The exchange rate has varied in recent years and is subject to further movement.\n        Exchange rates between transactional currencies may change rapidly. For instance, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian Real have experienced significant pressures as growth and other concerns,\nincluding those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have weighed on the Mexican and Brazilian economies, respectively. In addition, we have recognized foreign exchange losses related to the\ncurrency devaluation in Argentina and its designation as a highly inflationary economy under U.S. GAAP. See Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\" of the notes to consolidated financial\nstatements for further information regarding highly inflationary accounting.\n        To the extent currency devaluation continues across our business, we are likely to experience a lag in the timing to pass through U.S. dollar-denominated input costs across our business, which\nwould adversely impact our margins and profitability. As such, we may be exposed to future exchange rate fluctuations, and such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our reported cash flow,\nfinancial condition and results of operations, which effect may be material.\nInterest rates — An increase in interest rates could reduce our reported results of operations.\n        Fluctuations in interest rates can increase borrowing costs and have an adverse impact on results of operations. Accordingly, increases in short-term interest rates will directly impact the amount\nof interest we pay. Refer to Note 13, \"Debt,\" of the notes to consolidated financial statements for information about our variable rate borrowings and interest rates.\nCredit rating — A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n        In addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue commercial paper, drawdown bank loans and issue long-term bonds to meet our funding needs. Credit rating agencies rate\nour debt securities on many factors, including our financial results, their view of the general outlook for our industry, and their view of the general outlook for the global economy. Actions taken by\nthe rating agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading the current rating or placing us on a watch list for a possible future downgrade.

Our board of directors has\napproved a hedging policy to manage the risk of rising interest rates. The level of hedging activity undertaken may change from time to time and we may elect to change our hedging policy at any\ntime.

We review our goodwill balance for impairment at least once a year and whenever events or a change in\ncircumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred using the business valuation methods allowed in accordance with current accounting standards. These methods include the use of a\ndiscount rate to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows of our reporting units. Future changes in the cost of capital, expected cash flows, or other factors may cause our goodwill\nand/or other intangible assets to be impaired, resulting in a non-cash charge against results of operations to write down these assets for the amount of the impairment. In addition, if we make changes\nin our business strategy or if external conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affect our business operations we may be required to record an impairment charge for goodwill or\nintangibles, which would lead to decreased assets and reduced net operating results. If a significant write down is required, the charge would have a material adverse effect on our reported results of\noperations and net worth. We have identified the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill as a critical accounting estimate.

Section 404 requires us to furnish a report by\nmanagement on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our\nmanagement in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control that results in more than a reasonable possibility\nthat a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

We identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical AAS\nfinancial statements to U.S. GAAP. The first material weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of experience in technical accounting\nin U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic registrant. We have fully remediated this material weakness as of the end of fiscal year 2020, see \"Item 9A, Controls and\nProcedures,\" for further information.\n        We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end financial reporting process.

During fiscal year 2020, approximately 47,000 Amcor employees generated $12.5 billion in sales from operations that spanned approximately 231 locations in over 40 countries. \nSignificant Items Affecting the Periods Presented\nImpact of COVID-19\n        The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") has introduced a period of unprecedented uncertainty and challenge. Amcor’s operations have been largely recognized as 'essential' by governments\nand authorities around the world given the role we play in the supply chains for critical food and healthcare products. Our scale and global footprint has enabled us to collaborate with customers and\nsuppliers to meet volatile changes in demand and continue to service our customers. In dealing with the exceptional challenges posed by COVID-19, we have established three guiding principles\nfocusing on the health and safety of our employees, keeping our operations running and contributing to relief efforts in our communities.\nHealth and Safety\n        Our commitment to the health and safety of its employees remains our first priority. Our rigorous precautionary measures include the formation of global and regional response teams that\nmaintain contact with authorities and experts to actively manage the situation, restrictions on company travel, quarantine protocols for employees who may have had exposure or have symptoms,\nfrequent disinfecting of Amcor locations and other measures designed to help protect employees, customers and suppliers. We expect to continue these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is\nadequately contained for our business.\nOperations and Supply Chain\n        To support our business partners, we have instituted business continuity plans in each of our operations and offices globally which address infection prevention measures, incident response,\nreturn to work protocols and supply chain risks. We have experienced minimal disruptions to our operations to date as we have largely been deemed as providing essential services. However, we have\nexperienced volatility in customer order patterns in the second half of fiscal year 2020 and could continue to experience significant volatility in the demand for our products in the future. For instance,\nin April, our Rigid Packaging Segment sales volumes in North America and Latin America were adversely impacted as a result of a decrease in foot traffic in the convenience and on-the-go channels.\nOur facilities have largely been exempt from government mandated closure orders and while governmental measures may be modified, we expect that our operations will remain operational given the\nessential products we supply. However, despite our best efforts to contain the impact in our facilities, it remains possible that significant disruptions could occur as a result ",

However, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic or its ultimate impact\non the global economy and our operations and financial results. The ultimate near-term impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on the extent and nature of any future disruptions across\nthe supply chain, the duration of social distancing measures and other government imposed restrictions and the nature and pace of macroeconomic recovery in key global economies.\n25\n\n\nThe Acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc.\n        On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of 100% of the outstanding shares of Bemis Company, Inc. (\"Bemis\"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products based in the United\nStates, for the purchase price of $5.2 billion in an all-stock transaction. In connection with the Bemis transaction, we assumed $1.4 billion of debt.\n2019 Bemis Integration Plan\n        In connection with the acquisition of Bemis, we initiated restructuring activities in the fourth quarter of 2019 aimed at integrating and optimizing the combined organization. As previously\nannounced, we continue to target realizing approximately $180 million of pre-tax synergies driven by procurement, supply chain, and general and administrative savings by the end of fiscal year\n2022.\n        Our total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan pre-tax integration costs are expected to be approximately $200 million. The total 2019 Bemis Integration Plan costs include $165 million of restructuring\nand related expenses and $35 million of general integration expenses. The restructuring and related expenses are comprised of approximately $90 million in employee related expenses, $25 million in\nfixed asset related expenses, $20 million in other restructuring and $30 million in restructuring related expenses. We estimate that approximately $150 million of the $200 million total integration\ncosts will result in cash expenditures, of which $115 million relate to restructuring and related expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $80.2 million, of which $54.1 million were\npayments related to restructuring and related expenditures.

The restructuring related costs\nrelate primarily to the closure of facilities and include costs to replace graphics, train new employees on relocated equipment and anticipated loss on sale of closed facilities.\nOther Restructuring Plans\n        On August 21, 2018, we announced a restructuring plan in Amcor Rigid Packaging (\"2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan\") aimed at reducing structural costs and optimizing the footprint.\nThe Plan includes the closures of manufacturing facilities and headcount reductions to achieve manufacturing footprint optimization and productivity improvements as well as overhead cost\nreductions.\n        Our total 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan pre-tax restructuring costs are expected to be approximately $110 million with the main component being the cost to exit manufacturing\nfacilities and employee related costs. The total plan cost has been increased by approximately $15 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 due primarily to additional non-cash impairments.\nWe estimate that approximately $70 million of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million. The 2018 Rigid Packaging\nRestructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021.\n        On June 9, 2016, we announced a major initiative (\"2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan\") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative was\ndesigned to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the cost\nbase and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market.\n        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, we had closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. Our total pre-tax restructuring costs were $230.8\nmillion, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to dismantle equipment\nand terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million in total program costs resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4 million.\nThe Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2019.\n26\n\n\nImpairment in Equity Method Investment\n        Due to impairment indicators present for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 a",

The increase was primarily driven by the higher overall\nprofit of the total Company with a full year of Bemis’ results having been included compared to three weeks in fiscal year 2019.\n        The effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2020 reduced relative to 2019 mainly due to the decrease in non-deductible transaction costs related to the acquisition of Bemis. The current year\neffective tax rate is reflective of a greater proportion of the business in the U.S. as a result of the Bemis acquisition.\n30\n\n\nPresentation of Non-GAAP Information\n        This Annual Report on Form 10-K refers to financial measures that have not been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S.\nGAAP\"): adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (\"Adjusted EBIT\") from continuing operations, adjusted net income from continuing operations, and net debt. These non-GAAP financial\nmeasures adjust for factors that are unusual or unpredictable. These measures exclude the impact of significant tax reform, certain amounts related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates,\nacquisitions, and restructuring, including employee-related costs, equipment relocation costs, accelerated depreciation and the write-down of equipment. These measures also exclude gains or losses\non sales of significant property and divestitures, certain litigation matters, pension settlements and certain acquisition-related expenses, including transaction expenses, due diligence expenses,\nprofessional and legal fees, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, order backlog, intangible amortization, and changes in the fair value of deferred acquisition payments.\n        This adjusted information should not be construed as an alternative to results determined under U.S. GAAP. Management of the Company uses the non-GAAP measures to evaluate operating\nperformance and believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful to enable investors and other external parties to perform comparisons of current and historical performance of the Company.\n        A reconciliation of reported net income attributable to Amcor plc to Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations and adjusted net inco",

We manage our liquidity risk\ncentrally and such management involves maintaining available funding and ensuring that we have access to an adequate amount of committed credit facilities. Due to the dynamic nature of our\nbusiness, we aim to maintain flexibility within our funding structure through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, corporate bonds, unsecured notes, commercial paper and factoring. The following\nguidelines are used to manage our liquidity risk:\n•\nmaintaining minimum undrawn committed liquidity of at least $200 million that can be drawn at short notice;\n•\nregularly performing a comprehensive analysis of all cash inflows and outflows in relation to operational, investing and financing activities;\n•\ngenerally using tradable instruments only in highly liquid markets;\n•\nmaintaining a senior credit investment grade rating with a reputable independent rating agency;\n•\nmanaging credit risk related to financial assets;\n37\n\n\n•\nmonitoring the duration of long-term debt;\n•\nonly investing surplus cash with major financial institutions; and\n•\nto the extent practicable, spreading the maturity dates of long-term debt facilities.\n        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, an aggregate principal amount of $1,976.5 million and $221.2 million, respectively, was drawn under our commercial paper programs.

We expect to continue to fund our long-term business needs on the same basis as in the past, i.e., partially through the cash flow\nprovided by operating activities available to the business and management of the capital of the business, in particular through issuance of commercial paper and debt securities on a regular basis.

The selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation, as well as independent studies of trends\nperformed by our actuaries. However, actual results may differ substantially from the estimates that were based on the critical assumptions.\n        The amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset, in the case of an\noverfunded plan, or as a liability, in the case of an underfunded plan. The gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded\nas a component of other comprehensive income. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information\nabout the individuals covered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date\nrecognized over the average remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants. The service costs related to defined\nbenefits are included in operating income. The other components of net benefit cost are presented in the consolidated statement of income separately from the service cost component and outside\noperating income.\n        We review annually the discount rate used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities. The discount rate used at each measurement date is set based on a high-quality corporate bond\nyield curve, derived based on bond universe information sourced from reputable third-party indexes, data providers, and rating agencies. In countries where there is no deep market in corporate\nbonds, we have used a government bond approach to set the discount rate. For Mexico, Poland and Turkey, a corporate bond credit spread has been added to the government bond yields. Additionally,\nthe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived for each benefit plan by considering the expected future long-term return assumption for each individual asset class. A single long-term\nreturn assumption is then derived for each plan based upon the plan's target asset allocation.\nPension Assumptions Sensitivity Analysis\n        The following chart depicts the sensitivity of estimated fiscal year 2021 pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on assets.\nDiscount Rate\nTotal Increase (Decrease) to\nPension Expense from Current\nAssumption\nRate of Return on Plan Assets\nTotal Increase (Decrease) to\nPension Expense from Current\nAssumption\n(in millions)\n(in millions)\n+25 basis points\n0.1 \n+25 basis points\n(4.2)\n1.96 percent (current assumption)\n— \n3.52 percent (current assumption)\n— \n-25 basis points\n(0.2)\n-25",

Goodwill is not amortized but is instead tested annually or\nwhen events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Our reporting units each contain goodwill that is assessed for potential impairment. All goodwill is assigned to a reporting\nunit, which is defined as an operating segment, at the time of each acquisition based on the relative fair value of the reporting unit. We have six reporting units, of which five are included in our\nFlexibles Segment. The other reporting unit that is also a reporting segment is Rigid Packaging.\n        Goodwill for our reporting units is reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during\nthe year. When the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the\nreporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount of the carrying value of goodwill.\n        In performing our impairment analysis, we may elect to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary. If we determine that a quantitative test is necessary, or\nelect to perform a quantitative test instead of the qualitative test, we derive an estimate of fair values for each of our reporting units using income approaches. The most\n39\n\n\nsignificant assumptions used in the determination of the estimated fair value of the reporting units are the estimated net sales and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, discount\nrate and terminal values.\n        Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in\ndetermining fair value amounts, including undiscounted projected future cash flows. Judgment is used in assessing whether goodwill should be tested more frequently for impairment than annually.\nFactors such as a significant decrease in expected net earnings, adverse equity market conditions, and other external events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in the need for more frequent\nassessments.\n        Intangible assets consist primarily of purchased customer relationships, technology, trademarks and software and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,\nwhich range from one to 20 years.

These estimates and projections require judgments as to\nfuture events, conditions, and amounts of future cash flows.\nDeferred Taxes and Uncertain Tax Positions\n        We deal with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The determination of uncertain tax positions is based on an evaluation of\nwhether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return will be sustained on tax audit, including resolution of\nrelated appeals or litigation processes, if any. The recognized tax benefits are measured as the largest benefit of having a more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon settlement. Significant\nestimates are required in determining such uncertain tax positions and related income tax expense and benefit. Additionally, we are also required to assess the likelihood of recovering deferred tax\nassets against future sources of taxable income which might result in the need for a valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards if we\ndo not reach the more likely than not threshold based on all available evidence. Significant judgments and estimates, including expected future performance of operations and taxable earnings and the\nfeasibility of tax planning strategies, are required in determining the need for and amount of valuation allowances for deferred tax assets. If actual results differ from these estimates or there are future\nchanges to tax laws or statutory tax rates, we may need to adjust valuation allowances or tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of\noperations.\nEquity Accounted Investments\n        Investments in ordinary shares of companies, in which we believe we exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method of\naccounting. Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize our share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of acquisition and cash dividends paid. The\nassessment of whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other-than-temporary and the amount of such other-than-temporary decline requires significant estimates.\n        We review our investment in affiliated companies for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For example, we tested our\ninvestment in AMVIG Holdings Limited (\"AMVIG\") for impairment at March 31, 2020 given that the quoted share price had experienced a significant decline in the month of March associated with\ngeneral market declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Goodwill is measured as the excess of the consideration transferred, also measured at fair value, over the\nnet of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets.\n40\n\n\n        We use all available information to estimate fair values and typically engage outside appraisal firms to assist in the fair value determination for significant acquisitions. The fair value\nmeasurements are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. Critical estimates in valuing\nintangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected cash flows from customer relationships, acquired developed technology, corporate trade name and brand names; the period of time we expect\nto use the acquired intangible asset; and discount rates.\n        In estimating the future cash flows, we consider demand, competition, other economic factors and actuarial assumptions for defined benefit plans. We utilize common valuation techniques such\nas discounted cash flows and market approaches, including the relief-from-royalty method to value acquired developed technology, trade names and brand names. Customer relationships are valued\nusing the cost approach or an income approach such as the excess earnings method. We believe our estimates to be based on assumptions that are reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and\nunpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates, which could result in impairment charges in the future.\n        In connection with a given business acquisition, we may identify pre-acquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend our review and evaluation of these pre-acquisition\ncontingencies throughout the measurement period in order to obtain sufficient information to assess whether we include these contingencies as part of the fair value estimates acquired and liabilities\nassumed and, if so, to determine the estimated amounts.\n        In addition, uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in a business combination are initially estimated as of th",

Our hedging activities are conducted on a centralized basis through standard operating procedures and delegated authorities, which provide guidelines for control,\ncounterparty risk and ongoing reporting. These derivative instruments are designed to reduce the economic risk associated with movements in foreign exchange rates, raw material prices and to fixed\nand variable interest rates, but may not have been designated or qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility. However, we do not trade in\nderivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. In addition, we may enter into loan agreements in currencies other than the respective legal entity's functional currency to economically\nhedge foreign exchange risk in net investments in our non U.S. subsidiaries, which do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and hence may increase income statement volatility.\n        There have been no material changes in the risks described below, other than increased volatility in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, for the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 related to\ninterest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, raw material and commodity price risk and credit risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\n        Our policy is to manage exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, monitoring global interest rates and, where appropriate, hedging floating\ninterest rate exposure or debt at fixed interest rates through the use",

We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB)\nand are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange\nCommission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated\nfinancial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,\nand performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nOur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial\nstatements.

Our audit of internal\n44\n\n\ncontrol over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We\nbelieve that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the\nmaintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made\nonly in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use,\nor disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.\nThe communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\nmatter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment - Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America Reporting Units within the Flexibles Segment\nAs described in Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolid",

Management conducts an impairment\nanalysis in the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Management performed a quantitative assessment for\ngoodwill impairment, utilizing present value (discounted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value,\nmanagement would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and estimated fair value of the reporting unit, adjusted for any tax benefits, limited to the amount\nof the carrying value of goodwill. Management’s projected future cash flows for the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units included significant judgments and\nassumptions relating to revenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting\nunits within the Flexibles Segment is a critical audit matter are that there was significant judgment by management when developing the fair value measurement of the reporting units. This in turn led\nto a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s projected future cash flows and significant assumptions, including revenue growth,\nprojected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates. In addition, the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing these\nprocedures and evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the financial statements. These procedures included testing the\neffectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment analysis, including controls over the valuation of the Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America reporting units.\nThese procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate; evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow models; testing the\ncompleteness, accuracy, and relevance of underlying data used in the models; and evaluating the significant assumptions used by management, including\n45\n\n\nrevenue growth, projected operating income growth, terminal values, and discount rates.

The Company has a globally diverse operating footprint, selling to customers in\nEurope, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. The Company's sales are widely diversified, with the majority of sales made to the defensive food, beverage,\npharmaceutical, medical device, home and personal care, and other consumer goods end markets. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as to price, innovation, quality and service.\n53\n\n\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany\ntransactions and balances have been eliminated. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S.\nGAAP\").\nBusiness Combinations: The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting, which requires separate recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from goodwill, at the acquisition\ndate fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree over the net of the\nacquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company has the ability to\nrecord adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded in the consolidated statement of income.\nDiscontinued Operations Presentation: The consolidated financial statements and related notes reflect the three plants in Europe acquired as part of the Bemis acquisition as a discontinued\noperation in fiscal 2019 as the Company agreed to divest of these plants as a condition of approval from the European Commission. See Note 5, \"Discontinued Operations,\" for more information on\ndiscontinued operations. The plants were divested in the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nEstimates and Assumptions Required: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\n        These estimates are based on historical experience and various assumptions bel",

Management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis and\nadjusts or revises the estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their impacts cannot be determined with precision, actual results may differ from these estimates. In the opinion of\nmanagement, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary to fairly present the results of the periods presented.\n        The impact that the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic will have on the Company's consolidated operations is uncertain. The Company has considered the potential impacts of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic when developing the Company's estimates and judgements as of June 30, 2020, and will continue to evaluate the extent of the impact on the Company's business and\nconsolidated financial statements. The Company's accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 and the change could be material in future periods.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies: The reporting currency of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries is generally the local currency of such entity.\nTransactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in currencies\nother than the entity’s functional currency are remeasured at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date to the entity’s functional currency. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses related to\nshort-term and long-term debt are recorded in other non-operating income (loss), net, in the consolidated statement of income. The Company recorded such foreign currency transaction net loss of\n$0.4 million, net gain of $1.1 million and net loss of $82.7 million during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. All other foreign currency transaction gains and losses are\nrecorded in other income, net in the consolidated statement of income. These foreign currency transaction net gains amounted to $21.4 million, $8.9 million and $1.0 million during the fiscal years\nended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n        Upon consolidation, the results of operations of subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the reporting currency of the Company are translated using average exchange rates in effect\nduring each year. Assets and liabilities of operations with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated at the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date, while equity balances are\ntranslated at historical rates. Translation gains and losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of shareholders’ equity.\nHighly Inflationary Accounting: A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of approximately 100 percent or more over a thre",

If a\ncountry's economy is classified as highly inflationary, the financial statements of the foreign entity operating in that country must be remeasured to the functional currency of the parent. As of July 1,\n2018, the Argentine economy was designated as highly inflationary for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso as the functional currency for the Company's\nsubsidiaries in Argentina. The impact of\n54\n\n\nhighly inflationary accounting was $27.7 million and $30.2 million for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the consolidated statement of income.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company generates revenue by providing its customers with flexible and rigid packaging serving a variety of markets including food, consumer products and healthcare\nend markets. The Company enters into a variety of agreements with customers, including quality agreements, pricing agreements and master supply agreements which outline the terms under which\nthe Company does business with a specific customer. The Company also sells to some customers solely based on purchase orders. The Company has concluded for the vast majority of its revenues,\nthat its contracts with customers are either a purchase order or the combination of a purchase order with a master supply agreement. All revenue recognized in the consolidated statement of income is\nconsidered to be revenue from contracts with customers.\n        The Company typically satisfies the obligation to provide packaging to customers at a point in time upon shipment when control is transferred to customers. Revenue is recognized net of\nallowances for returns and customer claims and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. The Company does not have any material contract\nassets or contract liabilities. The Company disaggregates revenue based on geography. Disaggregation of revenue is presented in Note 20, \"Segments\".\nSignificant Judgments\n        Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. The\nCompany identified potential performance obligations in its customer master supply agreements and determined that none of them are capable of being distinct as the customer can only benefit from\nthe supplied packaging. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it has one performance obligation to supply packaging to customers.\n        The Company may provide variable consideration in several forms which are determined through its agreements with customers. The Company can offer prompt payment discounts, sales rebates\nor other incentive payments to customers. Sales rebates and other incentive payments are typically awarded upon achievement of certain performance metrics, including volume.

The Company utilizes forecasted sales data and rebate percentages specific to each customer agreement and updates its\njudgment of the amounts to which the customer is entitled each period.\n        The Company enters into long term agreements with certain customers, under which it is obligated to make various up-front payments for which it expects to receive a benefit in excess of the\ncost over the term of the contract. These up-front payments are deferred and reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets or other non-current assets on its consolidated balance sheet.\nContract incentives are typically recognized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the customer agreement.\nPractical Expedients\n        The Company sells primarily through its direct sales force. Any external sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would be one year or less. External sales\ncommission expense is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income.\n        The Company accounts for shipping and handling activities as fulfillment costs. Accordingly, shipping and handling costs are classified as a component of cost of products sold while amounts\nbilled to customers are classified as a component of net sales.\n        The Company excluded from the measurement of the transaction price all taxes assessed by a government authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing\ntransaction and collected from the customer, including sales taxes, value added taxes, excise taxes and use taxes. Accordingly, the tax amounts are not included in net sales.\n        The Company does not adjust the promised consideration for the time value of money for contracts where the difference between the time of payment and performance is one year or less.\nResearch and Development: Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred.\nRestructuring Costs: Restructuring costs are recognized when the liability is incurred. The Company calculates severance obligations based on its standard customary practices. Accordingly, the\nCompany records provisions for severance when probable and estimable and the Company has committed to the restructuring plan. In the absence of a standard customary\n55\n\n\npractice or established local practice, liabilities for severance are recognized when incurred. If fixed assets are to be disposed of as a result of the Company’s restructuring efforts, the assets are written\noff when the Company commits to dispose of them and they are no longer in use. Depreciation is accelerated on fixed assets for the period of time the asset continues to be used until the asset ceases\nto be used. Other restructuring costs, including costs to relocate equipment, are generally recorded as the cost is incurred or the service is provided.

Cash equivalents\ninclude certificates of deposit that can be readily liquidated without penalty at the Company’s option. Cash equivalents are carried at cost which approximates fair market value.\nTrade Receivables, Net: Trade accounts receivable, net, are stated at the amount the Company expects to collect, which is net of an allowance for sales returns and the estimated losses resulting from\nthe inability of its customers to make required payments. When determining the collectability of specific customer accounts, a number of factors are evaluated, including: customer creditworthiness,\npast transaction history with the customer and changes in customer payment terms or practices. In addition, overall historical collection experience, current economic industry trends and a review of\nthe current status of trade accounts receivable are considered when determining the required allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company has an allowance for doubtful accounts of $35.3 million\nand $34.4 million recorded at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in trade receivables, net, on the consolidated balance sheet. The current year expense to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts\nis recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income.\n        The Company enters into factoring arrangements from time to time to sell trade receivables to third-party financial institutions. Sales of receivables are accounted for in accordance with\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing (\"ASC 860\"). Agreements which result in true sales of the\ntransferred receivables, as defined in ASC 860, which occur when receivables are transferred without recourse to the Company, are reflected as a reduction of trade receivables, net on the\nconsolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Agreements that allow the Company to maintain\neffective control over the transferred receivables and which do not qualify as a true sale, as defined in ASC 860, are accounted for as secured borrowings and recorded in the consolidated balance\nsheets within trade receivables, net and short-term debt. The expenses associated with receivables factoring are recorded in the consolidated statement of income primarily as a reduction of net sales.\nFactored receivables not qualifying as a true sale were accounted for as secured borrowings. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, amounts factored recorded under trade receivables, net and short-term\ndebt, were zero and $152.7 million, respectively.\nInventories: Inventories are valued primarily at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") meth",

The Company\nreevaluates its leases on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising lease renewal options. Short term leases with a term of twelve months or less, including\nreasonably certain holding periods, are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. As the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing\nrate as of the commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The Company recognizes expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the\nconsolidated statement of income. Certain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on usage or output or may vary for other reasons. Variable lease payments that do not\ndepend on an index or rate are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability and recognized as expense in the period in which the obligation for the\npayments occur.\nGoodwill: Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but instead tested annually or whenever events and\ncircumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred during the year. Among the factors that could trigger an impairment review are a reporting unit’s operating results significantly declining\nrelative to its operating plan or historical performance, and competitive pressures and changes in the general markets in which it operates. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global\nimpacts, the Company considered the potential for goodwill impairment of its reporting units in the third fiscal quarter of 2020. The review did not indicate an impairment triggering event as of\nMarch 31, 2020.\n        All goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit, which is defined as the operating segment. In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company reassessed its segment reporting structure in\nthe first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexibles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America. With this change, the Company has\nsix reporting units with goodwill that are assessed for potential impairment.\n        In performing the required impairment tests, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill\nimpairment. If the qualitative assessment concludes that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. The\nCompany's quantitative assessment utilizes present value (discounted cash flow) methods to determine the fair value of the reporting units with goodwill.

If current expectations of future growth rates and margins are not met, or if market factors outside of Amcor’s control, such as factors\nimpacting the applicable discount rate, or economic or political conditions in key markets, change significantly, then goodwill allocated to one or more reporting units may be impaired.\n        The Company performs its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of each year.\n        A quantitative impairment analysis was performed in the fourth fiscal quarter for all reporting units for the fiscal years ended 2020 and 2018, while a qualitative analysis was performed for the\nfiscal year ended 2019. The Company’s annual impairment analysis for all three fiscal years concluded that goodwill was not impaired. The Company’s quantitative goodwill analysis in fiscal years\n2020 and 2018 concluded that the fair values substantially exceeded the carrying amounts for each reporting unit.\n        Although no reporting units failed the assessments noted above in the annual impairment analysis for 2020, during the time subsequent to the annual evaluation, and at June 30, 2020, the\nCompany considered whether any events and/or changes in circumstances, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, had resulted in the likelihood that the goodwill of any of its reporting\nunits may have been impaired. It is management's opinion that no such events have occurred.\nOther Intangible Assets, Net: Contractual or separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized against income using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives,\nwith original periods ranging from one to 20 years. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the costs of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the\namount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. The Company tests finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate carrying value\nmay not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows. If impaired, the assets are written down to fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values.\n        Costs incurred to develop software programs to be used solely to meet the Company's internal needs have been capitalized as computer software within other intangible assets.\nFair Value Measurements: The fair values of the Company's financial assets and financial liabilities reflect the amounts that would be received to sell the assets or paid to transfer the liabilities in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).

Each overfunded plan is recognized as an asset and each underfunded plan is\nrecognized as a liability. Pension plan liabilities are revalued annually, or when an event occurs that requires remeasurement, based on updated assumptions and information about the individuals\ncovered by the plan. Accumulated actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10 percent corridor and the prior service cost are amortized on a straight-line basis from the date recognized over the\naverage remaining service period of active participants or over the average life expectancy for plans with significant inactive participants.

Under this method, the investment is carried at cost and is adjusted to recognize the investor’s share of earnings or losses of the investee after the date of\nacquisition and is adjusted for impairment whenever it is determined that a decline in the fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. The fair value of the investment then becomes the\nnew cost basis of the investment and it is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries in fair value.

Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets\nand liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each balance sheet date, based upon enacted income tax laws and tax rates. Income tax expense or benefit is provided based on earnings reported\nin the consolidated financial statements. The provision for income tax expense or benefit differs from the amounts of income taxes currently payable because certain items of income and expense\nincluded in the consolidated financial statements are recognized in different time periods by taxing authorities.\n        Deferred tax assets, including operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that\nany portion of these tax attributes will not be realized. In addition, from time to time, management must assess the need to accrue or disclose uncertain tax positions for proposed adjustments from\nvarious tax authorities who regularly audit the Company in the normal course of business. In making these assessments, management must often analyze complex tax laws of multiple jurisdictions.\nAccounting guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax\nreturn. The Company records the related interest expense and penalties, if any, as tax expense in the tax provision.

The Company estimates that approximately $65 to $70 million of the $110 million total costs will result in cash expenditures. Cash payments for the fiscal year 2020 were $23.6 million.\nThe 2018 Rigid Packaging Restructuring Plan is expected to be completed during fiscal year 2021.\n2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan\n        On June 9, 2016, the Company announced a major initiative (\"2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan\") to optimize the cost base and drive earnings growth in the Flexibles segment. This initiative\nwas designed to accelerate the pace of adapting the organization within developed markets through footprint optimization to better align capacity with demand, increase utilization and improve the\ncost base and streamlining the organization and reducing complexity, particularly in Europe, to enable greater customer focus and speed to market.\n        As part of the 2016 Flexibles Restructuring Plan, the Company has closed eight manufacturing facilities and reduced headcount at certain facilities. The Company's total pre-tax restructuring\ncosts were $230.8 million, with $166.7 million in employee termination costs, $31.4 million in fixed asset impairment costs and $32.7 million in other costs, which primarily represent the cost to\ndismantle equipment and terminate existing lease contracts. Approximately $166 million of the $230.8 million total costs resulted in cash expenditures. Cash payments for fiscal year 2019 were $14.4\nmillion. The Plan was substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2019.\nOther Restructuring Plans\n        The Company entered into other individually immaterial restructuring plans (\"Other Restructuring Plans\"). The Company's restructuring charge related to these Plans was approximately $17.9\nmillion, $18.8 million and $25.8 million for the years ended June 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n66\n\n\nConsolidated Amcor Restructuring Plans\n        The total costs incurred from the beginning of the Company's material restructuring plans are as follows:\n(in millions)\n2016 Flexibles\nRestructuring Plan\n2018 Rigid Packaging\nRestructuring Plan\n2019 Bemis Integration\nPlan (1)\nOther Restructuring\nPlans\nTotal Restructuring and\nRelated Expenses (1)\nPrior years\n216.4 \n— \n— \n19.8 \n236.2 \nFiscal year 2018 net charges to earnings\n14.4 \n— \n— \n25.8 \n40.2 \nFiscal year 2019 net charges to earnings\n— \n64.1 \n47.9",

Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that have not been designated as hedging instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of income under other\nnon-operating income (loss), net.\n        As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, the total notional amount of the Company's receive-fixed/pay-variable interest rate swaps was $837.1 million and $841.1 million, respectively.\n        At June 30, 2020, the Company had a notional amount of $100 million (equivalent to €89.0 million) cross-currency interest rate swaps outstanding. The Company did not designate the swaps as\na hedging instrument and thus changes in fair value were immediately recognized in earnings.\n        During the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into six Treasury lock agreements to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to the highly probable issuance of\nlong-term debt. The total notional amount of the Treasury lock of $250.0 million was designated as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction and deemed these agreements to be highly\neffective.\n        The associated unsecured senior note was issued on June 19, 2020, and the Company has settled these Treasury lock agreements with a $19.8 million cash payment to the counterparties. The loss\nassociated with the settlement was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the unsecured senior notes, which is 10 years.\nForeign Currency Risk\n        The Company manufactures and sells its products and finances operations in a number of countries throughout the world and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange\nrates.

This exposes the Company to market price risk.\n        To manage the market price risk, the Company has entered into forward contracts for the purchase of its ordinary shares. As of June 30, 2020, the Company has entered into forward contracts\nthat mature in June 2021 to purchase 2.0 million shares at an average price of $10.68.

Equity is reduced by an amount equal to the fair value of the shares at inception.

The Company's valuation allowance increased by $72.9 million, increased by $20.4 million and increased by $5.3 million for fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nThe increase of the Company’s valuation allowance for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 is primarily attributed to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset arising from Swiss tax reform.\n        The decrease in deferred tax liability related to undistributed foreign earnings in fiscal year 2020 includes the tax impact of the EC Remedy sale of $82.5 million.\n        As of June 30, 2020, the Company has UK net operating losses (tax effected) and tax credits of approximately $2.9 million that do not expire. The Company has non-UK net operating losses (tax\neffected) and other tax attribute carryforwards of $50.9 million, the majority of which do not expire. The Company recorded valuation allowances against deferred tax assets associated with these net\noperating losses and tax credits. The benefits of these carryforwards are dependent upon the generation of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which they arose.\n        The Company considers the following factors, among others, in evaluating its plans for indefinite reinvestment of its subsidiaries' earnings: (i) the forecasts, budgets and financial requirements\nof the Company and its subsidiaries, both for the long term and for the short term; and (ii) the tax consequences of any decision to reinvest earnings of any subsidiary. The Company has not provided\ndeferred taxes on approximately $968.2 million of earnings in certain foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are indefinitely reinvested in its international operations. Upon distribution of such\nearnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, the Company may be subject to incremental foreign tax. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of\n95\n\n\nforeign tax that might be payable. A cumulative deferred tax liability of $26.9 million has been recorded attributable to undistributed earnings that the Company has deemed are no longer indefinitely\nreinvested. The remaining undistributed earnings of the Company's subsidiaries are not deemed to be indefinitely reinvested and can be repatriated at no tax cost. Accordingly, there is no provision\nfor income or withholding taxes on these earnings.\n        The Company accounts for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, \"Income Taxes.\" At June 30, 2020 and 2019, unrecognized tax benefits totaled $101.1 million and $102.6\nmillion, respectively, all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized.\n        The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

The Company will vigorously\ndefend its positions and believes it will prevail on most, if not all, of these matters. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's\nconsolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to\nany administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact the\nliquidity of Amcor. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company has recorded an accrual of $11.9 million and $16.4 million, respectively, included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated\nbalance sheet and has estimated a reasonably possible loss exposure in excess of the accrual of $18.4 million and $23.7 million, respectively. The litigation process is subject to many uncertainties\nand the outcome of individual matters cannot be accurately predicted. The Company routinely assesses these matters as to probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records the best estimate of\nthe ultimate loss in situations where the likelihood of an ultimate loss is probable. The Company's assessments are based on its knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any of these\nmatters may differ from the Company's estimates.\n        As of June 30, 2020, the Company provided letters of credit of $34.0 million, judicial insurance of $0.9 million and deposited cash of $10.1 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases\nreferenced above.\nContingencies - Environmental Matters\n        The Company, along with others, has been identified as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") at several waste disposal sites under U.S. federal and related state environmental statutes and\nregulations and may face potentially material environmental remediation obligations. While the Company benefits from various forms of insurance policies, actual coverage may not, or only partially,\ncover the total potential exposures. The Company has recorded $17.1 million aggregate accruals for its share of estimated future remediation costs as these sites.\n        In addition to the matters described above, the Company has also recorded aggregate accruals of $46.6 million for potential liabilities for remediation obligations at various worldwide locations\nthat are owned or operated by the Company, or were formerly owned or operated.\n        While the Company believes that its accruals are adequate to cover its future obligations, there can be no assurance that the ultim",

Nevertheless,\nbased on the available information, the Company does not believe that its potential environmental obligations will have a material adverse effect upon its liquidity, results of operations or financial\ncondition.\nLegal Proceedings\n        On April 18, 2019, prior to the closure of the Amcor and Bemis transaction, litigation funding firm, Burford Capital, notified Bemis on behalf of two shareholder funds (BCIM Strategic Value\nMaster Fund LP and BCIM SV SMA I LLC) that the funds would not accept the fixed exchange ratio for Amcor shares and instead intended to file a case asking a Missouri state court to appraise the\nvalue of their Bemis shares and compensate them accordingly. On June 24, 2019, the Burford funds sent a formal written demand for payment of the fair value of the funds’ shares. On September 6,\n2019, the Burford funds filed a Petition for Appraisal of Stock in the Missouri court. On November 4, 2019, Bemis filed an Answer to the Petition for Appraisal of Stock. On June 24, 2020, the\nparties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Release of all claims and two days later the case was dismissed with prejudice.\n        Two lawsuits brought by purported holders of Bemis stock against Bemis and Bemis directors and officers are pending in federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, in which plaintiffs are seeking damages for alleged violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations.\nPlaintiffs allege a failure to disclose adequately information in the proxy statement issued in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merger. The cases are: Dixon, et al. v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al. and\nStein v. Bemis Company, Inc. et al., which were instituted on April 15, 2019 and April 17, 2019, respectively. On March 10, 2020 the federal court in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District\nof New York consolidated the two pending cases into a single class action.\n102\n\n\n        In addition, a purported holder of Bemis stock filed a putative derivative suit in the Cole County Circuit Court, Nineteenth Judicial District of Missouri, against Bemis directors and Amcor,\nalleging that the directors breached fiduciary duties in connection with the Amcor-Bemis merger and that Amcor aided and abetted breaches of fiduciary duty. The case is Scarantino, et al. v. Amcor\nLimited, et al., which was instituted on April 19, 2019.\n        The Company intends to defend the claims made in the pending actions. It is too early for the Company to provide any reliable assessment of the likely quantum of any damages that may\nbecome payable if its defense is unsuccessful in whole or in part.

In conjunction with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company reassessed its segment reporting\nstructure in the first fiscal quarter of 2020 and elected to disaggregate the Flexibles Americas operating segment into Flexibles North America and Flexibles Latin America. The five Flexibles\noperating segments (Flexibles Europe, Middle East and Africa; Flexibles North America, Flexibles Latin America; Flexibles Asia Pacific and Specialty Cartons) have been aggregated in the Flexibles\nreporting segment as they exhibit similarity in economic characteristics and future prospects, similarity in the products they offer, their production technologies, the customers they serve, the nature of\ntheir service delivery models, and their regulatory environments.\n        In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in connection with the acquisition of Bemis, the Company changed its measure of segment performance from adjusted operating income to adjusted\nearnings before interest and tax (\"Adjusted EBIT\") from continuing operations. The Company's chief operating decision maker, the Global Management Team (\"GMT\"), evaluates performance and\nallocates resources based on Adjusted EBIT from continuing operations. The Company defines Adjusted EBIT as operating income adjusted to eliminate the impact of certain items that the Company\ndoes not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance and to include equity in income (loss) of affiliated companies. The GMT consists of the Managing Director and Chief Executive\nOfficer and his direct reports and provides strategic direction and management oversight of the day to day activities of the Company.\n        The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those in the consolidated financial statements and are discussed in Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies.\" The Company\nalso has investments in operations in AMVIG that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and, accordingly, those",

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure\nthat information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal\nexecutive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed, and\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgement in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and\nprocedures. Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30,\n2020 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting that was identified in our prospectus filed with the SEC on March 25, 2019 and is still being remediated, as described\nbelow.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n        Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Accordingly, even\neffective internal controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n        As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design\nand operating effectiveness of internal controls over the period end reporting process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to verify that conflicting duties were\nappropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and reporting of financial information. This control deficiency did not result in a misstatement of our consolidated financial\nstatements. However, the control deficiency could have resulted in misstatements of our interim or annual consolidated financial statements and disclosures that may have not been prevented or\ndetected on a timely basis.\n113\n\n\n        Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2020.

Given we operate many ERP systems globally, this effort has targeted the largest locations with standardized systems in fiscal 2020 and will be expanded to other locations in\nfiscal 2021. These enhanced processes, including the implementation of new mitigating controls, will effectively remediate the material weakness, but the material weakness will not be considered\nremediated until the revised controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we have concluded, through testing, they are designed and operating effectively. We currently expect that the\nremediation of this material weakness will be completed by the end of fiscal 2021. However, there is no assurance that the material weakness will be fully remediated by the end of fiscal 2021 as the\nseverity and length of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic is unknown and the remediation timeline could be negatively impacted because of inefficiencies caused by COVID-19\nlimitations on travel, meetings and on-site work.\nCompleted Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness\n        As previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness related to a lack of experience in\ntechnical accounting in U.S. GAAP and U.S. domestic registrant filing requirements. Since the material weakness has been identified, we have taken numerous steps to address the underlying causes\nand to remediate the material weakness. We have hired additional financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP technical accounting and financial reporting experience, as well as U.S. domestic\nregistrant filing experience, aligned our accounting policies and procedures with U.S. GAAP, enhanced our internal review procedures during the financial close process with U.S. GAAP experienced\nstaff, and have conducted technical training for accounting and finance personnel. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2020, we completed our testing of the operating effectiveness of the implemented\nsteps and found them to be effective.

Each of Amcor’s securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act are listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). CHESS Depositary Interests (“CDI’s”) representing our ordinary shares are traded on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”).\nDESCRIPTION OF ORDINARY SHARES\nThe following is a summary of the material terms of our ordinary shares as set forth in our Articles of Association and the material provisions of the laws of Jersey, Channel Islands. This summary\ndoes not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our Articles of Association, which are filed as an exhibit to the Annual Report on Form 10-K of which this Exhibit 4.26\nis a part.\nShare Capital\nThe authorized share capital of Amcor is $100,000,000, divided into 9,000,000,000 ordinary shares of $0.01 par value each and 1,000,000,000 preferred shares of $0.01 par value each, which may be\nissued in such class or classes or series as the our board of directors (“board”) may determine in accordance with our Articles of Association. As of August 25, 2020, we had 1,568,481,519 ordinary\nshares issued and outstanding.\nAll ordinary shares have equal voting rights and no right to a fixed income and carry the right to receive dividends that have been declared by Amcor. The holders of ordinary shares have the right to\nreceive notice of, and to attend and vote at, all general meetings of Amcor. The rights and obligations attaching to any preferred shares will be determined at the time of issue by our board in its\nabsolute discretion and must be set forth in a statement of rights. Any preferred shares that are issued may have priority over the ordinary shares with respect to dividend or liquidation rights or both.\nWe do not have any preferred shares issued and outstanding.\nOur board may issue ordinary shares or preferred shares without further shareholder action, unless shareholder action is required by applicable law or by the rules of the NYSE, ASX or other stock\nexchange or quotation system on which any class or series of our ordinary shares may be listed or quoted.\nSubject to our Articles of Association and the rights or restrictions attached to any shares or class of shares, if Amcor is wound up and the property of Amcor available for distribution among the\nshareholders is more than suf",

If Amcor is wound up, the directors or liquidator (as applicable) may, with the\nsanction of a special resolution of the shareholders of Amcor and any other sanction required by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (the “Jersey Companies Law”), divide among the shareholders the\nwhole or any part of the assets of Amcor and determine how the division will be carried out as between the shareholders or different classes of shareholders.\nCDIs are units of beneficial ownership in shares constituted under Australian law which may be held and transferred through the CHESS system.

An ordinary resolution requires approval by the holders of a majority of the voting rights\nrepresented at a meeting, in person or by proxy, and voting thereon. A special resolution requires approval by the holders of two-thirds of the voting rights represented at a meeting, in person or by\nproxy, and voting thereon (or such greater majority as the Articles of Association may prescribe).\nVoting rights with respect to any class of preferred shares (if any) will be determined by our board and set out in the relevant statement of rights for such class.\nNeither Jersey law nor the Articles of Association restrict non-resident shareholders from holding or exercising voting rights in relation of our ordinary shares. There are no provisions in the Jersey\nCompanies Law relating to cumulative voting.\nNo Preemptive Rights\nAmcor shareholders do not have preemptive rights to acquire newly issued ordinary shares.\nVariation of Rights\nThe rights attached to any class of ordinary shares, such as voting, dividends and the like, may, unless their terms of issue state otherwise, be varied by a special resolution passed at a separate\nmeeting of the holders of shares of such class.\nCertificated and Uncertificated Shares\nOrdinary shares may be held in either certificated or uncertificated form. Every holder of certificated shares is entitled, without payment, to have a certificate for the shares that it owns executed under\nAmcor",

Our board may rescind a decision to pay a dividend if it decides, before the payment date, that Amcor's financial\nposition no longer justifies the payment. The payment of a dividend does not require shareholder confirmation or approval at a general meeting of the shareholders.\nHolders of our ordinary shares are entitled to receive equally, on a per share basis, any dividends that may be declared in respect of ordinary shares by our board.\nOur board may direct that a dividend will be satisfied from any available source permitted by law, including wholly or partly by the distribution of assets, including paid up shares or securities of\nanother company. If Amcor declares cash dividends, such dividends will be declared in U.S. dollars.\nUnder the Jersey Companies Law, dividends may be paid from any source permitted by law (other than from nominal capital account and capital redemption reserve), subject to a requirement for the\ndirectors who are to authorize the payment of any dividend to make a statutory solvency statement.\nOur Articles of Association permit our board to require that all dividend payments will be paid only through electronic transfer into an account selected by the shareholder rather than by a bank\ncheck.\nNo dividend or other monies payable on or in respect of a share will bear interest as against Amcor (unless the terms of the share specify otherwise).\nIf any dividend is unclaimed for 11 calendar months after issuance, our board may stop payment on the dividend or otherwise make use of the unclaimed amount for the benefit of Amcor until\nclaimed or otherwise disposed of according to the laws relating to unclaimed monies.\n\n\nAlteration of Share Capital\nUnder the Jersey Companies Law, Amcor may, by special resolution of its shareholders: increase its share capital; consolidate and sub-divide; convert shares into or from stock; re-denominate any of\nits shares into another currency or reduce its share capital, capital redemption reserve or share premium account in any way.\nRedeemable Shares\nOur ordinary shares will not initially be redeemable.

If the purchase is to be made on a stock exchange, the special resolution\nmust specify the maximum number of shares or CDIs to be purchased, the maximum and minimum prices which may be paid, and the date on which the authority to purchase is to expire (which may\nnot be more than five years after the date of the resolution). If the purchase is to be made otherwise than on a stock exchange, the purchase must be made pursuant to a written purchase contract\napproved in advance by a resolution of shareholders (excluding the shareholder from whom Amcor proposes to purchase shares or CDIs).\nShareholder Meetings\nAnnual Meetings of Shareholders\nUnder Jersey law, Amcor must hold an annual general meeting once every calendar year and not more than 18 months may elapse between two successive annual general meetings, at such date, time\nand place as may be determined by our Board.\nA general shareholder meeting may only be called by a resolution of the board or as otherwise provided in the Jersey Companies Law.\nSpecial Meetings of Shareholders\nThe board may, and upon request of shareholders as required by Jersey law (and as described below) must, convene an extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders.\nUnder the Jersey Companies Law, shareholders of Amcor holding 10% or more of the company's voting rights and entitled to vote at the relevant meeting may legally require the directors to call a\nmeeting of shareholders. Upon receiving a requisition notice from shareholders, the board must call a special meeting as soon as practicable but in any case not later than two months after the date of\nthe requisition. If the directors do not within 21 days from the date of the deposit of the requisition proceed to call a meeting to be held within two months of that date, the requisitionists, or any of\nthem representing more than half of the total voting rights of all of them, may themselves call a meeting, but a meeting so called may not be held after three months from that date.\nNotice of Meetings; Record Date\nUnder the Articles of Association and applicable stock exchange listing rules, the notice for a general meeting must be sent to all shareholders. The content of a notice of a general meeting called by\nthe board is to be decided by the board, but it must designate the meeting as an annual or extraordinary general meeting and must state the general nature of the business to be transacted at the\nmeeting and any other matters required by the Jersey Companies Law.\n\n\nFor the purpose of determining whether a person is entitled as a shareholder to attend or vote at a meeting and how many votes s",

Amcor may specify a separate time by which a CDI holder must be on the CDI register in order to direct the Depositary Nominee (as defined herein) to vote or appoint a proxy.\nQuorum\nUnder the Articles of Association, no business may be transacted at any general meeting unless a quorum (the holders of shares representing at least the majority of total voting rights of all\nshareholders entitled to vote at such meeting) is present in person or by proxy at the time when the meeting proceeds to business.\nAction by Written Consent\nThe Articles of Association prohibit actions to be taken by unanimous written consent.

Ordinary shares are not traded on the financial market operated by the ASX. This is because ASX's electronic settlement system,\nknown as CHESS, cannot be used directly for the transfer of securities of issuers, such as Amcor, incorporated in countries whose laws do not recognize CHESS as a system to record uncertificated\nholdings or to electronically transfer legal title. CDIs have been created to facilitate electronic settlement and transfer in Australia for companies in this situation.\nCDIs are a type of depositary receipt which provide the holder with ultimate beneficial ownership of the underlying ordinary shares of Amcor. The legal title to these ordinary shares is held by Cede\n& Co., with CHESS Depositary Nominees Pty Ltd (ABN 75 071 346 506), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASX, which we refer to as the “Depositary Nominee,” holding the beneficial title to those\nordinary shares on behalf of CDI holders.\nEach CDI represents a beneficial interest in one ordinary share and, unlike ordinary shares, each CD",

The Notes are subject to defeasance as described under \"—Defeasance and covenant defeasance.”\nInterest\nThe Notes bear interest from the date of issuance, payable annually on June 23 of each year, beginning June 23, 2021, to the persons in whose names such Notes are registered at the close of business\non the date that is (i) in the case of Notes represented by a global note, the clearing system business day (for this purpose, a day on which Clearstream and Euroclear settle payments in euro)\nimmediately preceding the relevant interest payment and (ii) in all other cases, 15 calendar days prior to the relevant interest payment date (whether or not a Business Day) (for the purposes of clauses\n(i) and (ii), such day, the \"Record Date\"). Interest on the Notes will be computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the period for which interest is being calculated and the actual number of\ndays from and including the last date on which interest was paid on the Notes (or June 23, 2020, if no interest has been paid on the applicable Notes), to, but excluding, the next scheduled interest\npayment date. This payment convention is referred to as Actual/Actual (ICMA) as defined in the rulebook of the International Capital Market Association.\nIf any interest payment date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such interest payment date will be postponed to the next date that is a Business Day and no interest will accrue on the\namounts payable from and after such interest payment date to the next Business Day.

Further, a court will not make an order in respect of a preference to a person unless the company\nwas influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to improve that person's position in the event of the company's insolvent liquidation than if that thing had not been done, though this\ndesire is presumed where the preference is to a connected person.\nIn addition, if it can be shown that a transaction entered into by a company was made at an undervalue and was made for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach, or otherwise prejudicing the\ninterests, of persons who might claim against it, then the court may make such order as it thinks fit for restoring the position to what it would have been had the transaction not been entered into\n(including an order to set aside any transaction) and for protecting the interests of \"victims\" of the transaction.

However, to receive Employer Make- Up Matching Contributions in a Plan Year, an Eligible Employee must contribute the maximum amount allowable by law or the Employer under the Savings Plan. 4.5 Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions Effective as of January 1, 2005 and prior to January 1, 2012, the Employer may, in its sole discretion, make a contribution each Plan Year to Eligible Employees in the amount necessary to provide such Participants with the approximate benefits they will not receive under the Pension Plan due to: (i) the limitations of Section 401(a)(17) of the Code, (ii) the limitations of Section 415 of the Code, and (iii) the fact that a Participant’s Employee Contributions into this Plan are not included as compensation\nfor purposes of benefit accruals under the Pension Plan (“Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions”).

The Employer may, in its sole discretion, chose to make a contribution in any Plan Year for some or all Participants of less than the full amount necessary to make up the Pension Plan benefits due to items (i) through (iii) above. The following provisions and assumptions shall govern the determination of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions: (a) For purposes of determining the amount of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions each Plan Year, the Employer shall assume that the Participant will terminate employment and begin receiving benefits from the Pension Plan at the later of age 60 or the Participant’s attainment of five years of service (as defined in the Pension Plan), which benefits shall be assumed to be reduced for early commencement unless the Participant has attained age 65 and completed 5 years of service. If a Participant terminates employment after age 55 and completion of 5 years of service but prior to age 60, the Participant will receive a lesser amount of Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions than if the Participant had remained employed until age 60. If a Participant who is eligible for Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions remains employed by -9-\n\n\n \nan Employer until age 60 and completion of 5 years of service, the Participant will continue to receive Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions past such date to account for the Participant’s service after such date. (b) For purposes of determining the amount of a Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contribution each Plan Year, the Employer will base contributions on Compensation, the GAM 94 mortality table, and assumed Compensation increases of inflation plus 1.5%, provided that all actuarial assumptions may vary as the Committee determines advisable. The Employer will hypothetically assume that prior Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions on behalf of such Participant will increase at an earnings rate specified by the Committee, which as of January 1, 2005 equals the average of the 10-year Treasury US government securities plus 2%, notwithstanding the fact that the Participant’s Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions will be invested in the investment funds selected by the Participant in accordance with subsection 6.2 of the Plan. (c) Employer Make-Up Pension Contributions for eligible Participants will be fully funded by the Employer at the later of: (i) the Participant’s attainment of age 60, or (ii) the Participant’s completion of five years of service (as defined under the Pension Plan). However, if a Participant continues employment after age 60, the Committee shall determine the procedures for future funding of such Participant’s benefit. 4.6 Employer Special Contributions The Employer may, in its sole discretion, make an additional Employer Special Contribution in any Plan Year to Eligible Employees in an",

A Participant’s Employer 10% Target Contribution for the Plan Year shall equal 10% of the sum of the Participant’s Compensation for the Plan Year, reduced by all of the following that are paid or accrued (or deemed paid or accrued as described below) for the same Plan Year: (a) Savings Plan Retirement Savings Contributions; (b) Savings Plan New Employer Matching Contributions; (c) Savings Plan Employer Discretionary Matching Contributions; and (d) the Employer portion of the Social Security tax on the Eligible Employee's Compensation for the Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance (“OASDI”) -10-\n\n\n \nprogram, which amount is currently 6.2% of the Eligible Employee's Compensation.

(b) A Participant will fully vest in his Employer Special Contributions in his Accounts upon completion of five years of service (as defined under the Pension Plan). (c) A Participant will fully vest in his Employer 10% Target Contributions in his Accounts as follows: Years of Vested Service Percentage Less than 1 0% 1 20% 2 40% 3 60% 4 80% 5 or more 100% Years of service used to determine vesting in Employer 10% Target Contributions is defined under the Savings Plan.

In addition, all of a Participant’s Employer Contributions will fully vest upon the Participant’s death or Disability while actively employed by an Employer. Even if fully vested, a Participant will not receive the entire amount of Employer Make-up Pension Contributions deemed necessary to make up the Participant’s Pension Plan benefit if the Participant terminates employment prior to age 60.

In addition, any Participant who works for, counsels, advises, or otherwise assists a person, entity or business that is a “competing business,” before or after the Participant’s separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and the regulations, notices and other guidance thereunder, including death) from an Employer, shall forfeit 100% of the Participant’s Employer Contributions.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered**: \n   - We have multiple figures reported as net accounts receivable for FY2020, including \\$1,615.9 million, \\$787.2 million, \\$136.1 million, \\$133.3 million, \\$35.3 million, \\$425.6 million, \\$-7.2 million, and \\$34.4 million.\n   - The figures are extracted from various sections of the document, with some labeled as 'Trade receivables, net' and others from different sections like 'Deferred tax liabilities'.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**:\n   - The information is not sufficient to definitively answer the question due to the presence of multiple conflicting figures. The discrepancies between these figures need resolution.\n\n3. **Missing Information**:\n   - A clear identification of the correct line item from the balance sheet that represents the net accounts receivable for FY2020.\n   - Consistent citations or context that confirm which figure is the official net accounts receivable.\n\n4. **Conflicting Answers**:\n   - The figures \\$1,615.9 million and \\$787.2 million are both labeled as 'Trade receivables, net', which suggests they are the most relevant. However, without additional context or confirmation, it's challenging to determine which is correct.\n   - The citation for \\$787.2 million is more specific, indicating it is in USD millions and directly labeled as 'Trade receivables, net', which might suggest higher reliability.\n\n5. **Resolution**:\n   - To resolve the conflict, we should prioritize figures with clear and specific citations. The \\$787.2 million figure has a direct citation as 'Trade receivables, net', which aligns with the question's requirement for net accounts receivable.\n   - If possible, cross-reference with additional sections of the document or external sources to confirm the accuracy of this figure.\n\nIn conclusion, while we have multiple figures, the \\$787.2 million figure appears to be the most reliable based on its specific citation. However, further verification is recommended to ensure accuracy."
