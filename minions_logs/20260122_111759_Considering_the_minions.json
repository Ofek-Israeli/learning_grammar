Total length: 381486 characters.: \n\n## Question\nConsidering the data in the balance sheet, what is Block's (formerly known as Square) FY2016 working capital ratio? Define working capital ratio as total current assets divided by total current liabilities. Round your answer to two decimal places.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 381486 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine Block's FY2016 working capital ratio from the financial document, focus on extracting the total current assets and total current liabilities from the balance sheet for the fiscal year 2016. The working capital ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. Ensure that the figures you extract are specifically labeled as \"current\" to distinguish them from non-current or long-term assets and liabilities. Once you have these figures, perform the division and round the result to two decimal places to obtain the working capital ratio."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Therefore, our answer to this question would be 102.\", \"citation\": \"Total long-lived assets $164,793 $170,697 102\", \"answer\": \"102\"}",

In this case, we can find future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases and capital lease payments as of December 31, 2016. Among these payments, we can see that there's a total of $1,882 thousand for capital lease payments for 2017 and beyond. However, we also need to consider that there's a current portion of capital lease obligation of $691 thousand. Therefore, we subtract this amount from $1,882 thousand to get $1,191 thousand. However since we need to find total current liabilities for 2016 and there's no explicit section for current liabilities or balance sheet for 2016 we can't be sure if this amount includes other current liabilities. However since we can't find any other current liabilities we will use this amount as our answer.",

Wait for the next round to run sequential tasks.\n\nFunction #2 (transform_outputs): The second function will aggregate the outputs of the small language models and provide an aggregated string for the supervisor to review.\n-> Filter the jobs based on the output of the small language models (write a custome filter function -- in some steps you might want to filter for a specific keyword, in others you might want to no pass anything back, so you filter out everything!). \n-> Aggregate the jobs based on the task_id and chunk_id.\n\n\n\n# Misc. Information\n\n* Assume a Pydantic model called `JobManifest(BaseModel)` is already in global scope.

For your reference, here is the model:\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n* DO NOT rewrite or import the model in your code.\n\n* Function #1 signature will look like:\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Make sure to use **as much** information from the outputs as possible in final aggregated str (output.answer, output.sample, output.explanation, output.citation)\n\n        Note: Job has following attributes:\n        - manifest: JobManifest(chunk, task, advice, chunk_id, task_id, job_id)\n        - sample: entire response from the worker\n        - output: JobOutput(answer=\"\". explanation=\"\", citation=\"\", raw=\"\")\n    \"\"\"\n    ...\n\n```\n\n* You can assume you have access to the following chunking function(s).

However, since there's no explicit 'Current Liabilities' section for FY2016, we can infer that 'Total long-lived assets' might be related to non-current assets. Since we're looking for current liabilities and there's no direct mention of it, we can look for a difference between total assets and total long-lived assets. This difference might represent current assets or current liabilities. In this case, it seems to represent current liabilities as it's a small number compared to total assets.

However, we can infer that 'Cash and cash equivalents' and 'Settlements receivable' could be part of current assets. But without more specific information or a clear total for current assets for that year, we can't accurately determine it.\n\n### Chunk # 52\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 53\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 54\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 55\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 56\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 57\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`114`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no section labeled 'Current Assets' or similar for FY2016 in the given document excerpt.\n\n### Chunk # 58\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 59\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 60\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 61\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 62\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 63\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 64\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 65\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 66\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 67\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 68\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`136`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no section labeled 'Current Assets' or similar for FY2016 in the given document excerpt.\n\n### Chunk # 69\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 70\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 71\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`142`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no section labeled 'Current Assets' or similar for FY2016. However, we can find other financial data such as Adjusted EBITDA and Net loss for each quarter.\n\n### Chunk # 72\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`144`):\n   Answer: $452,030 + $59,901 + $22,131 = $534,062\n   Explanation: To find the total current assets for FY2016, we need to sum up 'Cash and cash equivalents', 'Short-term investments', and 'Short-term restricted cash' from the given table.\n   Citation: Year Ended December 31,\n2016\nCash and cash equivalents\n$452,030\nShort-term investments\n59,901\nLong-term investments\n27,366\nShort-term restricted cash\n22,131\n\n### Chunk # 73\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`146`):\n   Answer: $22.1 million\n   Explanation: We extracted the total current assets for FY2016 from the given chunk. Since there's no specific section labeled 'Current Assets' or similar for FY2016, we looked for any other sections that might provide this information. We found 'Short-term restricted cash of $22.1 million as of December 31, 2016' which seems to be a part of current assets.\n   Citation: Short-term restricted cash of $22.1 million as of December 31, 2016 reflects pledged cash deposited into savings accounts at the financial institutions that process our sellers' payments transactions and as collateral pursuant to an agreement with the originating bank for the Company's loan product.\n\n### Chunk # 74\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`148`):\n   Answer: $14.6 million\n   Explanation: We looked for sections labeled 'Current Assets' or similar for FY2016. However, we found that there was a mention of current assets and non-current assets. We extracted $14.6 million as it was specifically stated as 'Long-term restricted cash' which implies it's a non-current asset. However since we were asked for total current assets we should also look at other sections. We also see that 'We have recorded this amount as a current asset on our consolidated balance sheets given the short-term nature of these cash flow timing differences...' which implies that there's another current asset of unknown value. Since we can't determine this value from this snippet we will leave it as $14.6 million.\n   Citation: Long-term restricted cash of $14.6 million as of December 31, 2016 reflects cash deposited into money market accounts that is used as collateral pursuant to multi-year lease agreements entered into in 2012 and 2014 for our office buildings.\n\n### Chunk # 75\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`150`):\n   Answer: Increases in settlements receivable of $178.4 million and other current assets of $15.0 million\n   Explanation: To find the total current assets for FY2016, I looked for sections labeled 'Current Assets' or similar. However, I couldn't find a direct total. Instead, I extracted increases in settlements receivable and other current assets as they represent part of current assets.\n   Citation: including purchase of loans held for sale of $669.0 million , increases in settlements receivable of $178.4 million and other current assets of $15.0 million\n\n### Chunk # 76\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`152`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no section labeled 'Current Assets' or similar for FY2016. However, we can find other sections that might provide us with some clues. We can see that there's a section about 'Cash Flows from Operating Activities' but it doesn't provide us with any current assets. We can also see that there's a section about 'Contractual Obligations and Commitments' but it provides us with lease commitments and purchase commitments which aren't current assets. Therefore, we can't find any total current assets for FY2016.\n\n### Chunk # 77\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`154`):\n   Answer: Not Found\n   Explanation: No section labeled 'Current Assets' or similar was found for FY2016.\n\n### Chunk # 78\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`156`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: I was unable to find any section labeled 'Current Assets' or similar for FY2016.\n\n### Chunk # 79\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 80\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`160`):\n   Answer: 1,001,425\n   Explanation: To find the total current assets for FY 2016, I looked for sections labeled 'Current Assets' or similar.

However, we can find 'Total stockholders' equity' which might be related to assets. But we can't find total current assets directly.\n\n### Chunk # 82\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 83\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`166`):\n   Answer: Customer funds held ($34,128) + Merchant cash advance receivable ($31,102) + Other current assets ($-14,986) + Other assets ($631) = $50,875\n   Explanation: To find the total current assets for FY 2016, we need to look at the 'Changes in operating assets and liabilities' section.

However, we can find some related information about cash and cash equivalents.\n\n### Chunk # 85\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`170`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no explicit mention of total current assets for FY2016. However, there is a mention of an adjustment to customer funds as a component of current assets for 2015.\n\n### Chunk # 86\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 87\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`174`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no section labeled 'Current Assets' or similar for FY2016 in the given document excerpt.\n\n### Chunk # 88\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 89\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 90\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`180`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No specific total current assets for FY2016 were found.

I found a table under NOTE 2 - FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS that lists financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. I extracted the total from this table for December 31, 2016.\n   Citation: December 31, 2016\nTotal\n$234,166\n\n### Chunk # 100\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 101\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 102\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 103\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`206`):\n   Answer: $56,331\n   Explanation: To find the total current assets for FY2016, I looked for sections labeled 'Current Assets' or similar.

But it seems like it's only available for 2016 and 2015.\n\n### Chunk # 51\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 52\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 53\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 54\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 55\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 56\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 57\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`115`):\n   Answer: Not Found\n   Explanation: Total current liabilities for FY2016 were not specified in the given document chunk.\n\n### Chunk # 58\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 59\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 60\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 61\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 62\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 63\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 64\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 65\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 66\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 67\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 68\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`137`):\n   Answer: Not Found\n   Explanation: No section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar was found for FY2016.\n\n### Chunk # 69\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 70\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 71\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`143`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016. However, we can find total liabilities for each quarter. If you need total liabilities for a specific quarter or year, please let me know.\n\n### Chunk # 72\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 73\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`147`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No specific section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016 was found. However, we can infer that there might be some current liabilities from other sections. But without explicit mention of current liabilities for FY2016, we cannot provide a specific answer.\n\n### Chunk # 74\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 75\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`151`):\n   Answer: $172.4 million + $44.1 million\n   Explanation: To find the total current liabilities for FY2016, we need to look for sections labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar. However, since there isn't a specific section for 'Current Liabilities', we can infer that 'other current liabilities' and 'customers payable' contribute to current liabilities. Therefore, we add these two amounts together to get the total current liabilities.\n   Citation: increases in customers payable of $172.4 million and other current liabilities of $44.1 million\n\n### Chunk # 76\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`153`):\n   Answer: $35,410\n   Explanation: To find the total current liabilities for FY 2016, we need to look at the 'Payments due by period' table. This table shows our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of December 31, 2016. We can see that 'Less than 1 year' represents our current liabilities. Therefore, our total current liabilities for FY 2016 are $35,410.\n   Citation: Payments due by period\nTotal\nLess than 1 year\n1 - 3 years\n3 - 5 years\nMore than 5 years\n(in thousands)\nOperating leases\n116,703\n16,639\n32,192\n31,929\n35,943\nCapital leases\n1,882\n694\n1,187\n1\n—\nPurchase commitments\n18,077\n18,077\n—\n—\n—\nTotal\n$136,662\n$35,410\n$33,379\n$31,930\n$35,943\n\n### Chunk # 77\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`155`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016.

I extracted the values from each line under 'Current liabilities:' and added them up to get $577,464.\n   Citation: Current liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$ 12,602\nCustomers payable\n388,058\nCustomer funds obligation\n43,574\nAccrued transaction losses\n20,064\nAccrued expenses\n39,543\nOther current liabilities\n73,623\nTotal current liabilities\n577,464\n\n### Chunk # 81\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`163`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There's no section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016. However, we can find 'Total liabilities and stockholders' equity' which includes both current and non-current liabilities. But we can't extract total current liabilities from this chunk without additional information.\n\n### Chunk # 82\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 83\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`167`):\n   Answer: $779,239\n   Explanation: I looked for sections labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016. I extracted this value from 'Accounts payable' and 'Customers payable' and 'Customer funds obligation' and 'Charge-offs and recoveries to accrued transaction losses' and 'Accrued expenses' and 'Other current liabilities' and 'Other liabilities' under 'Changes in operating assets and liabilities' section.\n   Citation: (779,239)\n\n### Chunk # 84\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`169`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There is no section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016. However, we can find other sections that might be related to liabilities.

However, we can find total current liabilities by looking at 'Property and Equipment' and 'Merchant Cash Advance Receivable' sections. But we need to find total current assets or total liabilities to calculate total current liabilities. Since we can't find total current liabilities directly or indirectly from given sections for FY2016.\n\n### Chunk # 101\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 102\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 103\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`207`):\n   Answer: $73,623 + $39,543 + $56,331 = $169,497\n   Explanation: To find the total current liabilities for FY 2016, we need to sum up 'Other Current Liabilities', 'Accrued Expenses', and 'Other Current Assets' for 2016.\n   Citation: Other Current Liabilities\nDecember 31,\n  2016\nDecember 31,\n  2015\nSettlements payable\n$51,151\n$13,105\nEmployee early exercised stock options\n674\n2,141\nAccrued redemptions\n1,628\n1,066\nCurrent portion of deferred rent\n2,862\n2,393\nDeferred revenue\n5,407\n6,623\nOther\n11,901\n3,617\nTotal\n$73,623\n$28,945\n\nAccrued Expenses\nDecember 31,\n  2016\nDecember 31,\n  2015\nAccrued hardware costs\n$3,148\n$11,622\nProcessing costs payable\n9,655\n11,417\nAccrued professional fees\n5,788\n7,642\nAccrued payroll\n5,799\n2,660\nAccrued marketing\n3,972\n2,443\nOther accrued liabilities\n11,181\n8,617\nTotal\n$39,543\n$44,401\n\nOther Current Assets\nDecember 31,\n  2016\nDecember 31,\n  2015\nInventory\n$13,724\n$11,864\nAccounts receivable\n6,191\n4,808\nPrepaid expenses\n7,365\n7,101\nDeferred magstripe reader costs\n3,911\n4,018\nTenant improvement reimbursement receivable\n1,189\n1,788\nDeferred hardware costs\n4,546\n1,709\nProcessing costs receivable\n8,593\n7,847\nOther\n10,812\n2,312\nTotal\n$56,331\n$41,447\n\n### Chunk # 104\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`209`):\n   Answer: $1.859 million\n   Explanation: To find the total current liabilities for FY2016, I looked for sections labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar. I found a section labeled 'Current' under 'Total current provision for income taxes' which includes Federal, State and Foreign components.

However, since there's no explicit 'Current Liabilities' section for FY2016, we can infer that 'Total long-lived assets' might be related to non-current assets. Since we're looking for current liabilities and there's no direct mention of it, we can look for a difference between total assets and total long-lived assets. This difference might represent current assets or current liabilities. In this case, it seems to represent current liabilities as it's a small number compared to total assets. Therefore, our answer for total current liabilities for FY2016 is 102.\n   Citation: Total long-lived assets $164,793 $170,697 102\n\n### Chunk # 115\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`231`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No specific section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016 was found.\n\n### Chunk # 116\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 117\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 118\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 119\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 120\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 121\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 122\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 123\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 124\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 125\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`251`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No specific section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016 was found in the given document excerpt.\n\n### Chunk # 126\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 127\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`255`):\n   Answer: Not Found\n   Explanation: After reviewing the given document excerpts, I was unable to find any sections labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar for FY2016.\n\n### Chunk # 128\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n-----------------------\n\n\n## Instructions\nThink step-by-step about:\n1.
