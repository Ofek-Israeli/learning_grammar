Please help us compute it by basing your answers off of the cash flow statement and the income statement. Here's the question: what is the FY2022 retention ratio (using total cash dividends paid and net income attributable to shareholders) for General Mills? Round answer to two decimal places.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 415549 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To calculate the FY2022 retention ratio for General Mills, focus on extracting specific data from the financial document. You need the total cash dividends paid and the net income attributable to shareholders for the fiscal year 2022. These figures are typically found in the cash flow statement and the income statement, respectively. The retention ratio is calculated by subtracting the dividend payout ratio from 1. The dividend payout ratio is the total cash dividends paid divided by the net income attributable to shareholders. Ensure you have the correct fiscal year data and round your final answer to two decimal places."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Competition\nin  our  product  categories  is  based  on  product  innovation,  product  quality,  price,  brand  recognition  and  loyalty,  effectiveness  of\nmarketing, promotional activity,  convenient ordering and delivery to the consumer,  and the  ability to identify and satisfy consumer\npreferences.  Our principal strategies for competing  in each of our segments include unique consumer insights, effective  customer\nrelationships, superior product quality,  innovative advertising, product promotion, product innovation aligned with consumers ’ needs,\nan efficient supply chain, and price. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised, branded products,\nbut also  with regional  brands and  with generic  and private label products  that are  generally sold  at lower prices. Internationally,  we\ncompete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each country includes a unique group of competitors.\n\n\n5\nRaw materials, ingredients, and packaging\nThe principal raw materials that  we use are grains  (wheat, oats,  and corn), dairy products, sugar, fruits, vegetable  oils, meats,  nuts,\nvegetables,  and  other  agricultural  products.  We  also  use  substantial  quantities  of  carton  board,  corrugated,  plastic,  and  metal\npackaging materials, operating supplies, and energy.  Most of these inputs for our domestic and Canadian operations are purchased\nfrom suppliers in the United States. In our other international operations, inputs that are not locally available in adequate supply may\nbe imported  from other countries. The  cost of  these inputs may fluctuate  widely due  to external  conditions such  as weather,  climate\nchange, product scarcity,  limited sources of supply,  commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, trade tariffs, pandemics\n(including the COVID-19 pandemic), war, and changes in governmental agricultural and energy policies and regulations. We  believe\nthat we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of needed inputs. Occasionally and where possible, we make advance purchases of\nitems significant to our  business in  order to ensure  continuity of operations.  Our objective  is to  procure materials meeting both our\nquality standards  and our  production needs at price levels  that allow  a targeted  profit margin.  Since these inputs generally  represent\nthe largest variable cost in manufacturing our products, to the extent possible, we often manage the risk associated with adverse price\nmovements for some inputs using a variety of risk management strategies. We also have a grain merchandising operation that provides\nus efficient access to, and more informed knowledge of, various commodity markets, principally wheat and oats. This operation holds\nphysical inventories that are carried at net realizable value and uses derivatives to manage its net inventory position and minimize its\nmarket exposures.\nTRADEMARKS AND PATENTS\nOur  products  a",

We  believe\nachieving  that goal requires us to generate a consistent balance of net sales growth, margin  expansion, cash conversion, and cash\nreturn to shareholders over time.\nOur long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance on average over time:\n●\n2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales;\n●\nmid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit;\n●\nmid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS);\n●\nfree cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after tax; and\n●\ncash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow, including an attractive dividend yield.\nWe are executing  our Accelerate strategy to  drive sustainable,  profitable gro wth and top-tier shareholder  returns over  the long term. \nThe  strategy  focuses  on  four  pillars  to  create  competitive  advantages  and  win:  boldly  building  brands,  relentlessly  innovating,\nunleashing our scale,  and being a  force for  good. We  are prioritizing  our core  markets, global  platforms, and local gem  brands that\nhave  the  best  prospects  for  profitable  growth  and  we  are  committed  to  reshaping  our  portfolio  with  strategic  acquisitions  and\ndivestitures to further enhance our growth profile.\nWe expect that changes in consumer behaviors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic will result in ongoing elevated consumer demand\nfor food at home, relative to pre-pandemic levels. These changes include more time spent working from home and increased consumer\nappreciation for cooking  and baking.  We plan to  capitalize on  these opportunities,  addressing evolving  consumer needs through  our\nleading brands, innovation, and advantaged capabilities to generate profitable growth.\nIn fiscal 2022, we successfully adapted to the volatile operating environment, responding quickly to significant increases in input cost\ninflation and supply chain disruptions and keeping our brands available for our customers and consumers.  As a result, we were able to\ngrow organic net sales, adjuste",

Grain inventories are valued at net realizable value, and all related cash contracts and derivatives are valued at fair value, with\nall net changes in value recorded in earnings currently.\nInventories outside of the  United States are  generally valued at the lower  of cost, using  the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method,  or net\nrealizable value.\nShipping costs associated with the  distribution of finished product to our customers are recorded as  cost of sales and are recognized\nwhen the related finished product is shipped to and accepted by the customer.\nLand, Buildings, Equipment, and Depreciation \nLand is recorded at historical cost. Buildings and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded\nat cost and depreciated over estimated useful lives, primarily using the straight-line method. Ordinary maintenance and repairs are\ncharged  to  cost  of  sales.  Buildings  are  usually  depreciated  over 40  years,  and  equipment,  furniture,  and  software  are  usually\ndepreciated over 3 to 10 years. Fully depreciated assets are retained in buildings and equipment until disposal. When an item is sold or\nretired,  the  accounts  are  relieved  of  its  cost  and  related  accumulated  depreciation  and  the  resulting  gains  and  losses,  if  any,  are\nrecognized in earnings. \nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an\nasset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash\nflows from  the operation  and disposition  of the  asset group  are less  than the  carrying amount  of the  asset group.  Asset groups  have\nidentifiable cash flows and are largely independent of other asset groups.  Measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the\nexcess of the carrying amount of  the asset group  over its fair  value. Fair value is measured  using a ",

We  do not perform the assessments required to achieve\nhedge  accounting  for  commodity  derivative  positions.  Accordingly,  the  changes  in  the  values  of  these  derivatives  are  recorded\ncurrently in cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. \nAlthough we do not meet the criteria for cash flow hedge accounting, we believe that these instruments are effective in achieving our\nobjective of providing certainty in the future price of commodities purchased for use in our supply chain. Accordingly, for purposes of\nmeasuring  segment  operating  performance  these  gains  and  losses  are  reported  in  unallocated  corporate  items  outside  of  segment\n\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n60\noperating results until such time that the exposure we are managing affects earnings.

Those clearing systems could change their\nrules and procedures at any time.\n\n\n \n \nThe Notes are represented by one or more fully registered global notes. Each such global note is deposited with, or on behalf\nof, a common depositary, and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Clearstream and\nEuroclear. Except as set forth below,  the global notes may be transferred, in whole and not in part, only to Euroclear or Clearstream or\ntheir respective nominees.

Owners of book-entry\ninterests in the Notes receive payments relating to their Notes in euro, except as described under the heading “Payments in Euro.”\n \nClearstream and Euroclear have established electronic securities and payment transfer, processing, depositary and custodial\nlinks among themselves and others, either directly or through custodians and depositaries. These links allow the Notes to be issued,\nheld and transferred among the clearing systems without the physical transfer of certificates. Special procedures to facilitate clearance\nand settlement have been established among these clearing systems to trade securities across borders in the secondary market.\n \nThe policies of Clearstream and Euroclear will govern payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating to the\ninvestor’s interest in the Notes held by them. We  have no responsibility for any aspect of the records kept by Clearstream or Euroclear\nor any of their direct or indirect participants.

No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "Based on the collected outputs from the junior workers, we have the following information:\n\n1. **Net Income Attributable to Shareholders**: The net income attributable to shareholders for FY2022 is reported as \\$2.707.3 billion.\n\n2. **Total Cash Dividends Paid**: There is a mention of dividends paid totaling \\$1.244 billion for FY2022.\n\n3. **Citations**: The dividends paid figure is supported by a citation stating \"Dividends paid (FY2022): \\$1,244.5 million.\"\n\n### Analysis:\n\n1. **Sufficiency of Information**: \n   - We have both the net income attributable to shareholders and the total cash dividends paid for FY2022. This information is sufficient to calculate the retention ratio.\n\n2. **Calculation**:\n   - The retention ratio is calculated as: \n     \\[\n     \\text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\text{Total Cash Dividends Paid}}{\\text{Net Income Attributable to Shareholders}}\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Plugging in the values:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Retention Ratio} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1,244.5}{2,707.3}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n3. **Conflicting Information**:\n   - There are no conflicting figures for the net income or dividends paid. The figures provided are consistent and supported by citations.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - We can proceed to calculate the retention ratio using the provided figures. The calculation will yield the retention ratio for FY2022, rounded to two decimal places."
