      "output": "To determine Amazon's FY2019 net income attributable to shareholders from the income statement, focus on identifying the section labeled \"Net Income\" or \"Net Income Attributable to Shareholders.\" This figure represents the company's total earnings after all expenses, taxes, and costs have been deducted from total revenue. It is typically found towards the bottom of the income statement. Ensure that the figure is expressed in USD millions, as this is the required unit for the answer. Additionally, verify that the data corresponds specifically to the fiscal year 2019 to ensure accuracy."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

The `transform_outputs()` function then collects and aggregates the results from each chunk, focusing on the answers provided by the worker model. This approach ensures that the task remains atomic and chunk-local, while the supervisor handles the aggregation and interpretation of the results."

In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to sellers, vendors, publishers, and authors, through\nprograms such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.        \nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).

We design our stores to enable hundreds of\nmillions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customers access our offerings through our websites, mobile\napps, Alexa, devices, streaming, and physically visiting our stores. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle, Fire tablet, Fire TV, Echo,\nRing, and other devices, and we develop and produce media content. We seek to offer our customers low prices, fast and free delivery, easy-to-use functionality,\nand timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access\nto unlimited streaming of tens of thousands of movies and TV episodes, including Amazon Original content, and other benefits.\nWe fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-\nsourced and outsourced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer service centers globally, which\nare supplemented by co-sourced arrangements.

Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effected by\nadditional taxes of this nature imposed on us prospectively or retroactively or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection\nobligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In\nsome cases we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection\nobligations by the effective date.\nOur tax expense and liabilities are also affected by other factors, such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new\nbusinesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to\nrealize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in our\ndeferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and liabilities. In the ordinary\ncourse of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.

The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or\nissue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to\namounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nWe are also subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions that can result in tax assessments against us.

We also\nexpect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-\nparty sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with\nsuppliers.\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and\nmerchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to\ngeographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including\nAWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and\nimprove our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power, the advances of wireless\nconnectivity, and the practical applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and\nincrease its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy\ninnovative and efficient software and electronic devices.

There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary\ncourse of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our\nbusiness operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings,\nincluding earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have\nhigher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations,\nadministrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting\nrules in various",

Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in\nresponse to the U.S. Tax Act that could result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations to be performed that were not\npreviously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations,\nand the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting\nbodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued,\nwe may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which the\nadjustments are made.\nWe are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.\nDevelopments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for\nwhich that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these\nproceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals.

Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash\nreceived from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset by cash payments we make for products and\nservices, employee compensation, payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash\nreceived from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our\nreceivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow in 2019, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to the increase in net income,\nexcluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to\nchanges in working capital.

The primary components of other income (expense), net are related\nto equity securities and warrant valuations and foreign currency.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of\njurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments,\naudit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses),\nchanges in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework,\ncompetition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.\nAdditionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-\ndeductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.\nWe recorded a provision for income taxes of $1.2 billion and $2.4 billion in 2018 and 2019. Our provision for income taxes in 2019 was higher than in 2018\nprimarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income, a decline in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the\nU.S. Tax Act recognized in 2018.\nTax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. The U.S.\nTax Act enhanced and extended accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. As of\nDecember 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.7 billion of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal ta",

Our long-term debt is carried at\namortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impact our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a\nfixed rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates\nof interest.

Net sales and related expenses generated from our\ninternationally-focused stores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denominated in the\nfunctional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our\nintercompany balances associated with, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as\nforeign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the\nremeasurement of intercompany balances. For example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the\nprior year, International segment net sales decreased by $2.4 billion in comparison with the prior year.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of\nforeign funds as of December 31, 2019, of $15.3 billion, an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of\n$765 million, $1.5 billion, and $3.1 billion. Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss),” a separate component of\nstockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are\nmeasured at fair value with changes recognized in net income.\nWe have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances denominated in various foreign currencies.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the\nPCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing\nprocedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that\nrespond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements.

In each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers,\ndevelopers, enterprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer\nprograms that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app\ndevelopers, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global\ncompute, storage, database, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising to\nsellers, vendors, publishers, and authors, through programs such as sponsored ads, display, and video advertising.\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.”\nPrior Period Reclassifications\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash\nequivalents on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the reclassification of long-term capital lease obligations that existed at December 31, 2018 from\n“Other long-term liabilities” to “Long-term lease liabilities” within the consolidated balance sheets, as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance.

Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The\nfinancial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on\nAugust 28, 2017.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are\nused for, but not limited to, income taxes, useful lives of equipment, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based\ncompensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. For example, in Q4 2019 we\ncompleted a useful life study for our servers and are increasing the useful life from three years to four years for servers in January 2020, which, based on servers\nthat are included in “Property and equipment, net” as of December 31, 2019, will have an anticipated impact to our 2020 operating income of $2.3 billion.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-\naverage outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have a net\nloss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect.\n42\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):\n  \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2017\n2018\n2019\nShares used in computation of basic earnings per share\n480\n487\n494\nTotal dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards\n13\n13\n10\nShares used in computation of diluted earnings per share\n493\n500\n504\nRevenue\nRevenue is measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and\nrebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple\nperformance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price.

Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the\ncustomer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\nThird-party seller services - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of\nrecord in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are\nrendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer.\nSubscription services - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digital\nvideo, digital music, e-books, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits\nthat represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is\nrecognized over the subscription period.\nAWS - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone\nselling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity\ndelivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized\nratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term.\nOther - Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or\nimpressions.\nReturn Allowances\nReturn allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in\n“Accrued expenses and other” and were $468 million, $623 million, and $712 million as of December 31, 2017, 2018, and 2019. Additions to the allowance were\n$1.8 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.5 billion and deductions from the allowance were $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, and $2.5 billion in 2017, 2018, and 2019.

We consider\nmany factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of\nfuture earnings, capital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors.\nWe utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position\nfor recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of\nrelated appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon\nultimate settlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and\nwhich may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to\nmeasure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 — Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities\nin active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be\ncorroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3 — Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other\nmarket participants. These valuations require significant judgment.\nFor our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based on\nquoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based on recent trades of securities in inactive\nmarkets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as\nthrough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category.\nWe provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory,\nregardless of whether fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our inventories.\nWe also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our\nproducts. During the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreements with\ncontract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements\nconsists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand.

As of\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2019, customer receivables, net, were $9.4 billion and $12.6 billion, vendor receivables, net, were $3.2 billion and $4.2 billion, and seller\nreceivables, net, were $710 million and $863 million. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides funding\nto sellers primarily to procure inventory.\nWe estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired and\nwritten-off when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have acquired under build-to-suit lease\narrangements when we have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as servers\nand networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the underlying building, three years for our servers, five years for networking\nequipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense is classified within the\ncorresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of operations.\nLeases\nWe categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months as either operating or finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow us\nto substantially utilize or pay for the entire asset over its estimated life.

Our leases may include variable\npayments based on measures that include changes in price indices, market interest rates, or the level of sales at a physical store, which are expensed as incurred.\nCosts associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease. Finance lease assets\nare amortized within operating expenses on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or, in the instance where title does not\ntransfer at the end of the lease term, the lease term.

The new guidance aligns\nthe accounting for production costs of episodic television with that of movies by requiring production costs to be capitalized. Previously, we only capitalized a\nportion of the production costs related to our produced episodic television content. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2019 and began capitalizing substantially\nall of our production costs. Adoption of this ASU resulted in approximately $1.0 billion of incremental capitalized film costs classified in “Other Assets” as of\nDecember 31, 2019.\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNote 2 — FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2019, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money\nmarket funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and other investment grade securities.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax\npositions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes\nwill be due.

In our opinion,\nAmazon.com, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on the\nCOSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated\nbalance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’\nequity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 and the related notes and our report dated January 30, 2020 expressed an\nunqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to\nexpress an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and\nevaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary\nin the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

For instance, chunks 23, 45, 46, 47, 48, and 80 all report $11.588 billion, and these chunks have citations that reference net income figures.\n\nThere are a few conflicting outputs, such as chunk 0 and chunk 1, which report $11.59 billion, and chunk 90, which also reports $11.59 billion. However, the difference between $11.588 billion and $11.59 billion is minimal and likely due to rounding. The most frequently cited figure is $11.588 billion, which appears in multiple chunks with consistent citations.\n\nThere are also some outliers, such as chunk 33 reporting $14.5 billion and chunk 43 reporting $10.073 billion, but these figures are not supported by multiple sources and are likely errors or misinterpretations of different financial metrics (e.g., operating income or income before taxes).\n\nGiven the consistency and frequency of the $11.588 billion figure across multiple chunks and citations, it is reasonable to conclude that Amazon's FY2019 net income attributable to shareholders is $11.588 billion. This figure is sufficiently supported by the gathered information, and no additional data is needed to answer the question accurately."
