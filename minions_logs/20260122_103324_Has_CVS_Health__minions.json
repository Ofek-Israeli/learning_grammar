      "output": "To address the question regarding CVS Health's ongoing legal battles from 2022, 2021, and 2020, focus on extracting information related to litigation, regulatory investigations, and any legal proceedings mentioned in the financial document. Pay particular attention to sections typically dedicated to legal matters, such as \"Legal Proceedings,\" \"Contingencies,\" or \"Risk Factors.\" Look for disclosures about lawsuits, settlements, or regulatory actions that are described as having a material impact on the company's financial position or operations. Additionally, review the management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) for any commentary on significant legal challenges and their potential implications. Identifying any references to ongoing or unresolved legal issues, especially those highlighted as material, will be crucial in forming a comprehensive understanding of CVS Health's legal landscape during the specified years."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):\nChunk ID 10: There is a potential ongoing legal battle or material legal proceeding related to premium rate approvals by state or federal regulators. This could have a negative impact on CVS Health's future operating results. (Citation: Future operating results could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval is delayed by state or federal regulators.)\n\n## Instructions\nThink step-by-step about:\n1. What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "We have gathered information indicating a potential ongoing legal battle or material legal proceeding related to premium rate approvals by state or federal regulators. This issue could negatively impact CVS Health's future operating results. The citation provided suggests that the company's financial performance might be adversely affected if the requested premium rates are not approved, are adjusted downward, or if their approval is delayed.\n\n1. **Information Gathered**: We have identified a specific legal issue concerning premium rate approvals that could materially impact CVS Health. This is relevant to the question as it pertains to ongoing legal matters from the specified years.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information**: The information is somewhat sufficient as it highlights a legal issue with potential material impact. However, it lacks specific details about whether this issue is ongoing and if it directly pertains to the years 2020, 2021, or 2022.\n\n3. **Missing Information**: We need more details on whether this legal issue is indeed ongoing and specifically tied to the years in question. Additionally, it would be helpful to know if there are other legal battles or proceedings reported in those years.\n\n4. **Deriving the Answer**: If this is the only legal issue identified, and it is confirmed to be ongoing and relevant to the specified years, we could conclude that CVS Health has reported a materially important ongoing legal battle. However, without confirmation of its ongoing status and relevance to the specific years, the answer remains incomplete.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers**: There are no conflicting answers provided. The citation supports the identified legal issue, but further verification is needed to ensure it meets all criteria of the question.\n\nIn summary, while we have a lead on a potentially relevant legal issue, additional information is needed to fully answer the question regarding ongoing legal battles from 2020, 2021, and 2022."

New entrants into the\nmarketplace, as well as consolidation within the industry, have contributed to and are expected to intensify the competitive environment. In addition, the rapid\npace of change as the industry evolves towards a consumer-focused retail marketplace, including Insurance Exchanges, and the increased use of technology to\ninteract with members, providers and customers, increase the risks the Company faces from new entrants and disruptive actions by existing competitors\ncompared to prior periods.\nThe Company believes that the significant factors that distinguish competing health plans include the perceived overall quality (including accreditation\nstatus), quality of service, comprehensiveness of coverage, cost (including premium rates, provider discounts and member out-of-pocket costs), product\ndesign, financial stability and ratings, breadth and quality of provider networks, ability to offer different provider network options, providers available in such\nnetworks, and quality of member support and care management programs. The Company believes that it is competitive on each of these factors. The\nCompany’s ability to increase the number of persons covered by its health plans or to increase Health Care Benefits segment revenues is affected by its ability\nto differentiate itself from its competitors on these factors. Competition may also affect the availability of services from providers, including primary care\nphysicians, specialists and hospitals.\nInsured products compete with local and regional health care benefits plans, health care benefits and other plans sponsored by other large commercial health\ncare benefit insurance companies, health system owned health plans, new entrants into the marketplace and numerous for-profit and not-for-profit\norganizations operating under licenses from the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Ass",

The Company’s formularies provide recommended products in numerous drug classes to help ensure member access to\nclinically appropriate drugs with alternatives within a class under the client’s pharmacy benefit plan, while helping to drive the lowest net cost for clients that\nselect one of the Company’s formularies. To help improve clinical outcomes for members and clients, the Company conducts ongoing, independent reviews of\nall drugs, including those appearing on the formularies and generic equivalent products. Many of the Company’s clients choose to adopt a template formulary\noffering as part of their plan design.

Possible regulatory or legislative changes include the federal or one or more state governments\nfundamentally restructuring the Commercial, Medicare or Medicaid marketplace; reducing payments to the Company in connection with Medicare, Medicaid,\ndual eligible or special needs programs; increasing its involvement in drug reimbursement, pricing, purchasing, and/or importation; or changing the laws\ngoverning PBMs.\nThe Company has internal control policies and procedures and conducts training and compliance programs for its employees to help prevent, detect and correct\nprohibited practices. However, if the Company’s employees or agents fail to comply with applicable laws governing its international or other operations, it may\nface investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions.\nAny failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations summarized below, or any adverse applications or interpretations of, or changes\nin, the laws and regulations affecting the Company and/or its businesses, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial\ncondition, cash flows and/or stock price.

The Biden administration most recently renewed\nthe PHE on January 11, 2023 and has indicated that they intend for the PHE to expire on May 11, 2023. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (the\n“Families First Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) were enacted in March 2020. Each of the Families First\nAct and the CARES Act requires the Company to provide coverage for COVID-19 related medical services, in many cases without member cost-sharing, in its\nInsured Health Care Benefits products.\nThe CARES Act also provides relief funding to providers to reimburse them for health care related expenses incurred in preventing, preparing for and/or\nresponding to COVID-19 (provided no other source is obligated to reimburse those expenses) or lost health care related revenues that are attributable to\nCOVID-19. Under the CARES Act, the Company receives reimbursement for uninsured patients in connection with COVID-19 testing and vaccination as well\nas monoclonal antibody treatment. Aside from such reimbursement, the Company has not requested any funding under the CARES Act. However, in the\nsecond quarter of 2020, the Company received $43 million from the CARES Act provider relief fund, all of which was returned to the HHS during the second\nquarter of 2020.\nThe CARES Act also allows for the deferral of the payment of the employer share of Social Security taxes effective March 27, 2020 by permitting them to\nremit the associated payments in two equal installments on or about December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2022. The Company elected to defer approximately\n$670 million of its Social Security tax payments during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company paid the first of two equal installments in December\n2021 and the second installment in December 2022, as required under the CARES Act.\nCongress enacted the American Rescue Plan Act in March 2021.

Coverage for COVID-19 OTC test kits has subsequently been required by Medicare and, in many states, Medicaid. These\nrequirements may increase benefit costs in those businesses and jurisdictions, and may increase revenues in our retail business.

Potential sanctions for violating these\nlaws include recoupment or reduction of government reimbursement amounts, civil penalties, treble damages, and exclusion from participation in government\nhealth care programs. Such laws include the federal False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”), the federal anti-kickback statute (the “AKS”), state false claims\nacts and anti-kickback statutes in most states, the federal “Stark Law” and related state laws. In particular, the False Claims Act prohibits intentionally\nsubmitting, conspiring to submit, or causing to be submitted, false claims, records, or statements to the federal government, or intentionally failing to return\noverpayments, in connection with reimbursement by federal government programs. In addition, any claim for government reimbursement also violates the\nFalse Claims Act where it results from a violation of the AKS.\nBoth federal and state false claims laws permit private individuals to file qui tam or “whistleblower” lawsuits on behalf of the federal or state government.\nParticipants in the health and related benefits industry, including the Company, frequently are subject to actions under the False Claims Act or similar state\nlaws. The federal Stark Law generally prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries for certain services, including outpatient\nprescription drugs, to any entity with which the physician, or an immediate family member of the physician, has a financial relationship. The Stark Law further\nprohibits the entity receiving a prohibited referral from presenting a claim for reimbursement by Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to the\nprohibited referral.

For example, the ACA requires minimum MLRs for Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part\nD plans of 85%. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to\nenroll new members. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS. Due to\npotential lower utilization of medical services by Medicare beneficiaries during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible certain Medicare Advantage contracts\nmay not meet the 85% MLR for consecutive years.\nThe Company’s Medicare Advantage and PDP products are heavily regulated by CMS. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to the\nCompany and other private participants in Medicare programs are complex, expensive to comply with and subject to change. For example, the Medicare\nAdvantage Overpayment Rule, issued in 2014, implemented the ACA requirements that Medicare Advantage and PDP plans report and refund to CMS\noverpayments that those plans receive from CMS. Failure to notify overpayments to CMS could result in liability under the False Claims Act. The precise\ninterpretation, impact and legality of this rule are subject to pending litigation.

The new safe harbors are (i) for rebates which are passed on to\nthe patient at the point of sale and (ii) for flat service fee payments made to PBMs which cannot be tied to the list prices of drugs. It is unclear whether the\nRebate Rule will be enforceable, whether pharmaceutical companies will respond by reducing list prices, whether list prices in the private market may also be\nreduced, and what the resulting impact will be to PBMs or the Company. The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (the “PCMA”), which represents\nPBMs, has filed a suit in an effort to block the Rebate Rule, claiming that the Rebate Rule would lead to higher premiums in Medicare Part D and was adopted\nin an unlawful manner. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Act of 2021 delays the effective date of the rebate rule to January 2026, and the Inflation Reduction Act,\nenacted in August 2022, further delays the Rebate Rule through 2032.\nIn July 2022, the 2% Medicare sequester required by the Budget Control Act of 2011 resumed, meaning that Medicare claims incur a 2% reduction in Medicare\npayment. The sequester had been suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGoing forward, the Company expects CMS, the OIG, the DOJ, other federal agencies and the U.S. Congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component\nof the Medicare program (including Medicare Advantage, PDPs, demonstration projects such as Medicare-Medicaid plans and provider network access and\nadequacy), modify the terms and requirements of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurers’ roles. It is also possible that Congress may\nconsider changes to Medicare Advantage payment policies due to recent recommendations by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and to reduce the\npotential added cost burden of costly new benefits, or policies that impact drug pricing such as price controls and inflationary rebates applied to pharmaceutical\nmanufacturers.\nIt is not possible to predict the outcome of such regulatory or Congressional activity, any of which could materially and adversely affect the Company.\nMedicare Audits - CMS regularly audits the Company’s performance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and to\nassess the quality of services it provides to Medicare Advantage and PDP beneficiaries.

The Company also has received Civil\nInvestigative Demands (“CIDs”) from, and provided documents and information to, the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with a current investigation of\nits patient chart review processes in connection with risk adjustment data submissions under Parts C and D of the Medicare program.\nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule concerning Part C contract-level Risk Adjustment Data Validation Audits (the “RADV Audit Rule”). The\nRADV Audit Rule eliminated the application of a fee-for-service adjuster (“FFS Adjuster”) in contract-level RADV audits but continued the use of\nextrapolation in such audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. The FFS Adjuster that was announced in 2012 was to be used by CMS to determine a\npermissible level of payment error. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare Advantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent\nthat their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original Medicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare\nAdvantage organizations are subject. Under the RADV Audit Rule, CMS, in most cases, will conduct RADV audits for payment year 2018 and subsequent\npayment years using extrapolation without the application of a FFS Adjuster. The RADV Audit Rule may have potential adverse effects, which could be\nmaterial, on the Company’s operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. CMS also has announced that it will not conduct RADV audits on all\ncontracts; instead, it will only audit contracts it believes are at the highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling.\nMedicare Star Ratings - A portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement is tied to the plan’s “star ratings.” The star rating system considers a\nvariety of measures adopted by CMS, including quality of preventative services, chronic illness management, compliance and overall customer satisfaction.\nOnly Medicare Advantage plans with an overall star rating of 4 or more stars (out of 5 stars) are eligible for a quality bonus in their basic premium rates. As a\nresult, the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans’ operating results in 2023 and going forward will be significantly affected by their star ratings.

The main driver of this decrease was a 1 star decrease in the Company’s Aetna National PPO, which dropped from 4.5 to 3.5\nstars, while many of the Company’s other plans remain rated at 4 or more stars. The decrease in the star rating for the Aetna National PPO will mean that it will\nno longer be eligible for CMS’ quality bonus payments related to 2024, though the Company’s contract diversification efforts, which will partially mitigate\ncertain adverse impacts associated with the decrease in the star rating for the Aetna National PPO, have received regulatory approval. CMS also gives PDPs\nstar ratings that affect each PDP’s enrollment. Medicare Advantage and PDP plans that are rated less than 3 stars for three consecutive years are subject to\ncontract termination by CMS. CMS continues to revise its star ratings system to make it harder to achieve 4 or more stars. There can be no assurances that the\nCompany will be successful in maintaining or improving its star ratings in future years.

Final 2023 Medicare\nAdvantage rates resulted in an expected average increase in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 5.00%, excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare\nAdvantage risk score trend. On February 1, 2023, CMS issued an advance notice detailing proposed 2024 Medicare Advantage payment rates. The 2024\nMedicare Advantage rates, if finalized as proposed, will result in an expected average decrease in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 2.27%,\nexcluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. CMS intends to publish the final 2024 rate announcement no later than April 3, 2023. The\nfederal government may seek to impose restrictions on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider networks for Medicare Advantage and/or PDP plans, or\notherwise restrict the ability of these plans to alter benefits, negotiate prices or establish other terms to improve affordability or maintain viability of products.\nThe Company currently believes that the payments it has received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the Company’s continued\nparticipation in the Medicare Advantage and PDP programs, although there are economic and political pressures to continue to reduce spending on the\nprogram, and this outlook could change.\n340B Drug Pricing Program – The 340B Drug Prici",

To the extent\n22\n\n\nthat the Company appears to have actual or potential market power in a relevant market or CVS pharmacy, CVS specialty or MinuteClinic plays a unique or\nexpanded role in a Health Care Benefits or Pharmacy Services segment product offering, the Company’s business arrangements and uses of confidential\ninformation may be subject to heightened scrutiny from an anti-competitive perspective and possible challenge by state and/or federal regulators and/or private\nparties.\nPrivacy and Confidentiality Requirements - Many of the Company’s activities involve the receipt, use and disclosure by the Company of personally\nidentifiable information (“PII”) as permitted in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy and data security laws, which require organizations to\nprovide appropriate privacy and security safeguards for such information. In addition to PII, the Company uses and discloses de-identified data for analytical\nand other purposes when permitted. Additionally, there are industry standards for handling credit card data known as the Payment Card Industry Data Security\nStandard, which are a set of requirements designed to help ensure that entities that process, store or transmit credit card information maintain a secure\nenvironment. Certain states have incorporated these requirements into state laws or enacted other requirements relating to the use and/or disclosure of PII.\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”), as further modified by\nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) impose extensive requirements on the way in which health plans, providers, health care\nclearinghouses (known as “covered entities”) and their business associates use, disclose and safeguard protected health information (“PHI”). Further, ARRA\nrequires the Company and other covered entities to report any breaches of PHI to impacted individuals and to the HHS and to notify the media in any states\nwhere 500 or more people are impacted by the unauthorized release or use of or access to PHI. Criminal penalties and civil sanctions may be imposed for\nfailing to comply with HIPAA standards.

The HITECH Act also extended HIPAA privacy and security requirements and penalties directly to business associates. HHS has begun to audit health\nplans, providers and other parties to enforce HIPAA compliance, including with respect to data security.\nIn addition to HIPAA, state health privacy laws apply to the extent they are more protective of individual privacy than is HIPAA, including laws that place\nstricter controls on the release of information relating to specific diseases or conditions and requirements to notify members of unauthorized release or use of or\naccess to PHI. States also have adopted regulations to implement provisions of the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (also known as the Gramm-Leach-\nBliley Act (“GLBA”)) which generally require insurers, including health insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal\nhealth and financial information is used and the opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures before the insurer shares such information with a non-affiliated\nthird party. Like HIPAA, GLBA sets a “floor” standard, allowing states to adopt more stringent requirements governing privacy protection. Complying with\nadditional state requirements requires us to make additional investments beyond those the Company has made to comply with HIPAA and GLBA.\nThe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and, among other\nthings, directs HHS to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the health care industry. In addition, states have begun to\nenact more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data access, deletion, protection or transparency, such as the California\nConsumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). States also are starting to issue regulations and proposed regulations specifically related to cybersecurity, such as the\nregulations issued by the New York Department of Financial Services. Complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations, which may differ from state to\nstate, requires significant resources. In addition, differing approaches to state privacy and/or cyber-security regulation and varying enforcement philosophies\nmay materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to standardize its products and services across state lines. Widely-reported large scale commercial\ndata breaches in the United States and abroad increase the likelihood that additional data security legislation will be considered by additional states.

These standards may differ from, and be\nmore stringent than, HIPAA.\nConsumer Protection Laws - The federal government has many consumer protection laws, such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Federal Postal\nService Act and the Consumer Product Safety Act. Most states also have similar consumer protection laws and a growing number of states regulate subscription\nprograms. In addition, the federal government and most states have adopted laws and/or regulations requiring places of public accommodation, health care\nservices and other goods and\n23\n\n\nservices to be accessible to people with disabilities. These consumer protection and accessibility laws and regulations have been the basis for investigations,\nlawsuits and multistate settlements relating to, among other matters, the marketing of loyalty programs, and health care products and services, pricing accuracy,\nexpired front store products, financial incentives provided by drug manufacturers to pharmacies in connection with therapeutic interchange programs,\ndisclosures related to how personal data is used and protected and the accessibility of goods and services to people with disabilities. As a result of the\nCompany’s direct-to-consumer activities, including mobile and web-based solutions offered to members and to other consumers, the Company also is subject\nto federal and state regulations applicable to electronic communications and to other general consumer protection laws and regulations.

The rule requires group health plans and health insurance issuers in the individual and group markets to disclose cost-sharing\ninformation upon request, to a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and require plans and issuers to publicly disclose in-network provider rates, historical out-of-\nnetwork allowed amounts and the associated billed charges, and negotiated rates and historical net prices for prescription drugs.

Many of these agencies have broad enforcement powers, conduct audits on a regular\nbasis, can impose substantial fines and penalties, and may revoke the license, registration or program enrollment of a facility or professional.\nState Insurance, HMO and Insurance Holding Company Regulation - A number of states regulate affiliated groups of insurers and HMOs such as the\nCompany under holding company statutes. These laws may, among other things, require prior regulatory approval of dividends and material intercompany\ntransfers of assets and transactions between the regulated companies and their affiliates, including their parent holding companies. The Company expects the\nstates in which its insurance and HMO subsidiaries are licensed to continue to expand their regulation of the corporate governance and internal control\n24\n\n\nactivities of its insurance companies and HMOs.

Laws that may apply in such cases include\ninsurance laws and laws governing MCOs and limited prepaid health service plans. In addition, several states require that PBMs become directly registered or\nlicensed with the department of insurance or similar government oversight agency regardless of any arrangements they have with clients. PBM licensure laws\nmay include oversight of certain PBM activities and operations and may include auditing of those activities.\nThe states of domicile of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance\ncompanies and HMOs based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (the “NAIC”) Risk-Based Capital for Insurers Model Act (the “RBC\nModel Act”).

The RBC Model Act sets forth the formula for calculating RBC requirements, which are designed to\ntake into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual company’s business. In general, under\nthese laws, an insurance company or HMO must submit a report of its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of\ndomicile for each calendar year.

Under those statutes, without such approval (or an exemption), no person may acquire any\nvoting security of an insurance holding company (such as the Company’s ultimate parent company, CVS Health Corporation) that controls an insurance\ncompany or HMO, or merge with such a holding company, if as a result of such transaction such person would control the insurance holding company. Control\nis generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a\nperson directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person.\nCertain states have laws that prohibit submitting a false claim or making a false record or statement in order to secure reimbursement from an insurance\ncompany.

In addition to its\nfiduciary provisions, ERISA imposes civil and criminal liability on service providers to health plans and certain other persons if certain forms of illegal\nremuneration are made or received. These provisions of ERISA are broadly written and their application to specific business practices is often uncertain.\nSome of the Company’s health and related benefits and large case pensions products and services and related fees also are subject to potential issues raised by\njudicial interpretations relating to ERISA.

The Company has taken steps to be able to continue to serve customers in the European Economic Area following the\nUnited Kingdom’s exit from the EU (“Brexit”).\nThe Company’s international operations are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by\njurisdiction, including anti-corruption laws; economic sanctions laws; various privacy, insurance, tax, tariff and trade laws and regulations; corporate\ngovernance, privacy, data protection (including the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation which began to apply across the EU during 2018), data mining,\ndata transfer, labor and employment, intellectual property, consumer protection and investment laws and regulations; discriminatory licensing procedures;\ncompulsory cessions of reinsurance; required localization of records and funds; higher premium and income taxes; limitations on dividends and repatriation of\ncapital; and requirements for local participation in an insurer’s ownership. In addition, the presence of operations in foreign countries potentially increases the\nCompany’s exposure to the anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering provisions of U.S. law, including the FCPA, and corresponding foreign\nlaws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”).\nAnti-Corruption Laws - The FCPA prohibits offering, promising or authorizing others to give anything of value to a foreign government official to obtain or\nretain business or otherwise secure a business advantage. The Company also is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws of the jurisdictions in which it\noperates. In many countries outside the United States, health care professionals are employed by the government. Therefore, the Company’s dealings with them\nare subject to regulation under the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as\nother penalties, and there continues to be a heightened level of FCPA enforcement activity by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and\nthe DOJ. The UK Bribery Act is an anti-corruption law that is broader in scope than the FCPA and applies to all companies with a nexus to the United\nKingdom. Disclosures of FCPA violations may be shared with the UK authorities, thus potentially exposing companies to liability and potential penalties in\nmultiple jurisdictions.\nAnti-Money Laundering Regulations - Certain lines of the Company’s businesses are subject to Treasury anti-money laundering regulat",

In general, these limitations apply to certain customer\nsegments and limit the Company’s ability to set prices for new or renewing groups, or both, based on specific characteristics of the group or the group’s prior\nclaim experience. In some states, these laws and regulations restrict the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes and/or reflect reasonable costs in the\nCompany’s pricing.\nThe ACA expanded the premium rate review process by, among other things, requiring the Company’s Commercial Insured rates to be reviewed for\n“reasonableness” at either the state or the federal level. HHS established a federal premium rate review process that generally applies to proposed premium rate\nincreases equal to or exceeding a federally (or lower state) specified threshold. HHS’s rate review process imposes additional public disclosure requirements as\nwell as additional review on filings requesting premium rate increases equal to or exceeding this “reasonableness” threshold. These combined state and federal\nreview requirements may prevent, further delay or otherwise affect the Company’s ability to price for the risk it assumes, which could adversely affect its\nMBRs and operating results, particularly during periods of increased utilization of medical services and/or medical cost trend or when such utilization and/or\ntrend exceeds the Company’s projections.\nThe ACA also specifies minimum MLRs of 85% for large group Commercial products and 80% for individual and small group Commercial products. Because\nthe ACA minimum MLRs are structured as “floors” for many of their requirements, states have the latitude to enact more stringent rules governing these\nrestrictions. For Commercial products, states have and may adopt higher minimum MLR requirements, use more stringent definitions of “medical loss ratio,”\nincorporate minimum MLR requirements into prospective premium rate filings, require prior approval of premium rates or impose other requirements related\nto minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured Commercial\nproducts while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to\nsignificant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.\nIn addition, the Company requested increases in its premium rates in its Commercial Health Care Benefits business for 2023 and expects to request future\nincreases in those rates in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trends, required expansions of coverage and rating limits, and significant\nassessments, fees and taxes imposed by the federal and state governments, including as a result of the ACA.

These rate increases may be significant and thus heighten the risks of\nadverse publicity, adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that the Company’s requested premium rate increases will be denied,\nreduced or delayed, which could lead to operating margin compression.\nMany of the laws and regulations governing the Company’s pricing and underwriting practices also limit the differentials in premium rates insurers and other\ncarriers may charge between new and renewal business, and/or between groups based on differing characteristics. They may also require that carriers disclose\nto customers the basis on which the carrier establishes new business and renewal premium rates and limit the ability of a carrier to terminate customers’\ncoverage.\nMedicaid Regulation - The Company is seeking to substantially grow its Medicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan businesses over the next\nseveral years. As a result, the Company also is increasing its exposure to changes in government policy with respect to and/or regulation of the various\nMedicaid, dual eligible and dual eligible special needs plan programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to the\nCompany under those programs.\nIn addition to a quality rating system that applies to Medicaid and Managed Medicaid plans, federal regulations give states the option to choose to establish a\nminimum MLR of at least 85% for their Managed Medicaid plans, including those offered by the Company. Regardless of whether a state establishes a\nminimum MLR, it must use plan-reported MLR data to set future\n30\n\n\npayment rates for managed care, so that its plans will “reasonably achieve” an MLR of at least 85%. For Managed Medicaid products, states may use more\nstringent definitions of “medical loss ratio”, use discretion in choosing a quantitative standard for determining provider network adequacy, or impose other\nrequirements related to minimum MLR. Minimum MLR requirements and similar actions further limit the level of margin the Company can earn in its Insured\nMedicaid products while leaving the Company exposed to medical costs that are higher than those reflected in its pricing. The Company also may be subject to\nsignificant fines, penalties, premium refunds and litigation if it fails to comply with minimum MLR laws and regulations.\nStates continue to consider Medicaid expansion; however, to date 12 states have not expanded, which will drop to 11 states once South Dakota’s expansion\ntakes effect in July 2023.

Similarly, credentialing organizations such as URAC have established voluntary\nstandards regarding PBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy activities. While the actions of these quasi-regulatory or standard-setting\norganizations do not have the force of law, they may influence states to adopt their requirements or recommendations and influence client requirements for\nPBM, mail order pharmacy and/or specialty pharmacy services.

MAC prices specify the allowable reimbursement by a PBM for a particular strength and dosage of a generic drug that is\navailable from multiple manufacturers but sold at different prices. State legislation can regulate the disclosure of MAC prices and MAC price methodologies,\nthe kinds of drugs that a PBM can pay for at a MAC price, and the rights of pharmacies to appeal a MAC price established by a PBM. These laws could\nnegatively affect the Company’s ability to establish MAC prices for generic drugs. Additionally, some states have passed legislation that would restrict certain\ntypes of retroactive reconciliation or recoupment from pharmacies in the network or create a reimbursement benchmark mandate, such as the national average\ndrug acquisition cost and/or the wholesale acquisition cost (“WAC”), plus a set dispensing fee, for pharmacies in the network.\nFormulary and Plan Design Regulation - A number of government entities regulate the administration of prescription drug benefits.

If there is a rise in infection rates or the development of new variants or viruses, we may have to re-institute, extend or expand these\ninitiatives, which could adversely impact our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition. In addition, measures that were imposed to\nlimit the spread of COVID-19 may also be re-instituted, which may lead to impacts including, but not limited to, complete or partial facility closures, labor\nshortages, financial difficulties of third-party providers, supply chain disruptions and re-introduction of remote work arrangements.

COVID-19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against us.\n36\n\n\nWe believe COVID-19’s continuing impact on our businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by vaccination\nrates; the severity of any new COVID-19 variants and the continued effectiveness of vaccines; and whether federal, state and local governments reinstitute\nand/or intensify policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, including new and existing variants, and to address the financial\nimpacts of a pandemic through additional legislation and other support programs.

There can be no assurance that future health care and other benefits costs will not exceed our projections.\nCOVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause unanticipated and significant volatility in our health care and other benefits costs, including COVID-19\nrelated testing and vaccination and post-acute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health costs. In January 2021, the President of the United States\nissued an executive order to support government efforts to expand access, availability and use of COVID-19 diagnostic, screening and surveillance and\naddressed the cost of COVID-19 testing by facilitating COVID-19 testing free of charge to those who lack comprehensive health insurance and clarifying\ngroup health plans’ and health insurance issuers’ obligations to provide coverage for COVID-19 testing. In January 2022, the HHS announced that commercial\nhealth insurers must cover the cost of up to eight rapid COVID-19 OTC test kits per individual per 30-day period. In addition, the timing of vaccine\nadministration to the general public and related costs as well as the identification of new, more infectious strains of the COVID-19 virus and whether the\nvaccines will be effective against such new strains are uncertain and may impact our MBR.\nPremiums for our Insured Health Care Benefits products, which comprised 93% of our Health Care Benefits revenues for 2022, are priced in advance based on\nour forecasts of health care and other benefit costs during a fixed premium period, which is generally twelve months.

For example, our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted in June of the year before the contract\nyear. Cost increases in excess of our projections cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. As a result, our profits are\nparticularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecasts of the increases in health care and other benefit costs that we expect to occur and our ability to anticipate\nand detect medical cost trends. For 2023, those forecasts include adjustments made to pricing based on prospective expectations for liabilities due to testing,\nvaccines, direct COVID-19 treatment and deferred care. Risk-adjusted revenue has been adjusted for deferred care, and forecasted enrollment considers\nassumptions about the economic environment, though COVID-19 related impacts remain uncertain.

In addition, government-imposed limitations on Medicare and Medicaid\nreimbursements to health plans and providers have caused the private sector to bear a greater share of increasing health care and other benefits costs over time,\nand future amendments to the ACA that increase the uninsured population may amplify this issue. Other factors that affect our health care and other benefit\ncosts include epidemics or other pandemics, changes as a result of the ACA, changes to the ACA and other changes in the regulatory environment, the\nevolution toward a consumer driven business model, new technologies, influenza-related health care costs (which may be substantial and higher than we\nexpected), clusters of high-cost cases, health care\n37\n\n\nprovider and member fraud, and numerous other factors that are or may be beyond our control. For example, the 2020-2021 influenza season was impacted by\nefforts taken to reduce the spread of COVID-19; and the 2019-2020 influenza season had an earlier than average start and had a higher incidence of influenza\nthan the 2018-2019 influenza season.\nOur Health Care Benefits segment’s operating results and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and\nother benefit costs through underwriting criteria, product design, provider network configuration, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical\nmanagement programs. Our medical cost management programs may not be successful and may have a smaller impact on health care and benefit costs than we\nexpect. The factors described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit costs, which can adversely affect our\ncompetitiveness and operating results.\nFurthermore, if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trends or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet\nreported claims or reported claims that have not been paid, our ability to take timely corrective actions to limit future health care costs and reflect our current\nbenefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited, which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating results. These\nrisks are particularly acute during periods when health care and other benefit costs, utilization and/or medical cost trends experience significant volatility and\nmedical claim submission patterns are changing rapidly as a result of COVID-19. Such risks are further magnified by the ACA and other existing and future\nlegislation and regulations that limit our ability to price for our projected and/or experienced increases in utilization and/or medical cost trends.\nMany of the requirements set forth above may change once the PHE expires.

During the second quarter,\nCOVID-19 testing and treatment costs persisted, however at levels significantly lower than those observed during the first quarter. Beginning in the third\nquarter of 2021, medical costs once again increased primarily driven by the spread of emerging new variants of COVID-19, which resulted in increased testing\nand treatment costs throughout the remainder of the year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the impact of COVID-19 within the Health Care Benefits segment has generally stabilized as a result of the\nCompany’s ability to capture COVID-19 related medical costs in pricing.\nRetail/LTC Segment\nDuring March 2020, the Company experienced increased prescription volume due to the greater use of 90-day prescriptions and early refills of maintenance\nmedications, as well as increased front store volume as consumers prepared for the COVID-19 pandemic. Beginning in the second quarter and continuing\nthroughout the remainder of the year, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies and MinuteClinic locations due to shelter-in-\nplace orders as well as reduced new therapy prescriptions and decreased long-term care prescription volume as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In\naddition, the Company incurred incremental operating expenses associated with the Company’s COVID-19 pandemic response efforts and waived fees\nassociated with prescription home delivery and associated front store products. During 2020, the Company also played a key role in supporting the local\ncommunities in which it operates through the administration of diagnostic testing at its CVS pharmacy locations, as well as in long-term care facilities, at\ncommunity-based testing sites in underserved areas and through its Return Ready\nsolution. The Company also began administering COVID-19 vaccinations\nin long-term care facilities during December 2020.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, the Company experienced reduced customer traffic in its retail pharmacies, which reflected the impact of a weaker cough, cold\nand flu season, while it administered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. The Company began administering COVID-19 vaccines in its\nretail pharmacies during February 2021. During the second quarter, the segment generated earnings from COVID-19 vaccines and saw improved customer\ntraffic as vaccinated customers began more actively shopping in CVS locations.

During the first quarter, the Company saw high volumes of administration of COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as demand for OTC test kits in the\nfront store, particularly in the beginning of the year when\nSM \n71\n\n\nthe Omicron variant incidence was high. In addition, the Company administered the highest quarterly volume of COVID-19 diagnostic tests of 2022 during the\nfirst quarter, however a decline compared to the prior year. During the second and third quarters, the Company continued to generate earnings from the sale of\nOTC test kits, as customers performed more in-home testing versus diagnostic testing, in addition to earnings from the continued administration of COVID-19\ndiagnostic testing and vaccinations, albeit at lower levels than those experienced in the first quarter. During the fourth quarter, the Company saw an increase in\nCOVID-19 vaccine administration from the prior quarter related to the bivalent COVID-19 booster.

Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will\nhave on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.

Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not\ndirectly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally,\nintangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of\nintangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business\nperformance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial\nstatements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the\nrelated non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or\nthe estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n(2)\nIn 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the\nplanned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to the Company’s new flexible work arrangement.

The increase was primarily due to incremental costs associated with\nincreased volume, increased investments in the segment’s operations and capabilities, as well as decreased gains from legal settlements in 2022 compared\nto 2021.

The RBC framework described above for\ninsurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to\nbe important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are\napplied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.

These adjustments are known\nas retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As\ninformation regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the\nperiod in which they arise. A significant difference in the actual level of retroactivity compared to estimated levels would have a significant effect on the\nCompany’s operating results.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance\nfor estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the MLR rebate requirements of the ACA is recorded net of the\nestimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported\nas other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such\nadjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer\nemerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange\nfor performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some\nof the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim\nprocessing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain\nrange. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk\ntypically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved.

The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by\nCMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance\nliabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable\nconsideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional\nsubsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income\ncost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference\nis recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail\npharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no\ncontractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in\ntime. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the\ndispensing of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the\nprescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions dispensed indirectly through its retail pharmacy\nnetwork because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary\nresponsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.\nRevenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and\nrefunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order\nprescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (i",

The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the\nPharmacy Services segment:\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by mail service dispensing pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the\nclient plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does\nnot experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees\nare recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the\nCompany has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.\nFor contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is\nrecognized using the net method.\nDrug Discounts\nThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The\nCompany estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients.\nThe estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client.\nThe Company adjusts its rebates\n94\n\n\npayable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur.

The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or\nfinancial condition.\nGuarantees\nThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance\nmetrics.

ExtraSavings are coupons that\nare recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional\ngoods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level.\nExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional\nperformance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the\nExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue\nallocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a\ncontract liability.\nThe Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, CarePass , under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the\ncourse of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for future goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly\nor annual basis at the time of or in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the\nperformance obligations are satisfied.\nLong-term Care\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration",

For real estate leases, the\noptions to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the\neconomic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the\nrenewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and\nlease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of\nbeing exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require\nadditional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as\nincurred as variable lease costs.

Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2022 and 2021 with claim incurred dates for the fourth\nquarter of the previous year, the Company observed health care costs that were 4.8% and 5.0% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously\nestimated, resulting in a reduction of $622 million and $581 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.\nManagement considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing\nestimates of current health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2022, the Company increased its assumed health care cost\ntrend rates for the most recent three months by 4.9% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. Health care cost trend rates during the past three years\nhave been impacted by utilization changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact has not been uniform, with products and select geographies\n100\n\n\nexperiencing utilization impacts due to COVID-19 waves. Based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s estimated health\ncare cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $487 million\npretax.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for any temporary differences\nbetween financial and tax reporting bases and are adjusted as needed to reflect changes in the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary\ndifferences reverse. Such adjustments are recorded in the period in which changes in tax laws are enacted, regardless of when they are effective. Deferred tax\nassets are reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance to the extent future realization of those losses, deductions or other tax benefits is sufficiently\nuncertain.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since, in the\nordinary course of business, there a",

Additionally, the Company’s tax returns are\nsubject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments based on differing interpretations of the tax laws.\nAlthough management believes that its estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time the provision is prepared, actual\nresults could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in the consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nThe tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing\nauthorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such positions are then\nmeasured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the related tax authority. Interest and/or\npenalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision. Significant judgment is required in determining uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company has established accruals for uncertain tax positions using its judgment and adjusts these accruals, as warranted, due to changing facts and\ncircumstances.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company.\n101\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A.

If a debt security is in an unrealized loss\nposition and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of\nits amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related\ncomponent is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other\ncomprehensive income (loss). The impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of\nDebt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.\nEvaluation of Market Valuation Risks\nThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term\nor long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of\ninvestments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial\ncondition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate\nchanges (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the\nCompany. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a\nrepresentative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates\n(which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive\ninvestments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.\nAssuming an immediate inc",

Changes in the fair value of\nlong-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\n•\nThe theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate\nsensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $595 million ($750 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-\nrated products.

See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’\nfor additional information on the Company’s sale of PayFlex.\n113\n\n\nInvestments\nDebt Securities\nDebt securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate and foreign bonds and other debt securities.\nDebt securities are classified as either current or long-term investments based on their contractual maturities unless the Company intends to sell an investment\nwithin the next twelve months, in which case it is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities are classified as available for sale and\nare carried at fair value.

If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that\nthe Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-\ncredit related (yield-related) components.

The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the\namount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest is not accrued on debt securities when management\nbelieves the collection of interest is unlikely.\nThe credit-related component is determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security, considering all reasonably\navailable information relevant to the collectability of the security, with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be\ncollected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, the Company records an allowance for credit losses, which is limited by the amount that the fair\nvalue is less than amortized cost basis.\nFor mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the\nestimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and\nanticipated future payments. The Company’s investment in the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been\napplied since the acquisition of the security, with adjustments recognized in net income.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities with readily available fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nMortgage Loans\nMortgage loan investments on the consolidated balance sheets are valued at the unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans\nwith a maturity date or a committed prepayment date within twelve months are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company assesses\nwhether its loans share similar risk characteristics and, if so, groups such loans in a risk pool when measuring expected credit losses. The Company considers\nthe following characteristics when evaluating whether its loans share similar risk characteristics: loan-to-value ratios, property type (e.g., office, retail,\napartment, industrial), geographic location, vacancy rates and property condition.\nCredit loss reserves are determined using a loss rate method that multiplies the unpaid principal balance of each loan within a risk pool group by an estimated\nloss rate percentage. The loss rate percentage considers both the expected loan loss severity and the probability of loan default.

Interest income on problem loans (i.e., more than 60 days delinquent, in bankruptcy or in\nprocess of foreclosure) is recognized on a cash basis. Cash payments on loans in the process of foreclosure are treated as a return of principal.\n114\n\n\nOther Investments\nOther investments consist primarily of the following:\n•\nPrivate equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value\nof the investment is based on the value of the Company’s equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager\nof the investments, the financial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by\nthe fund managers, these investments are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least\nquarterly and monitors their performance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the\nCompany becomes aware of an impairment of a limited partnership’s investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership’s\nfinancial statements at the financial statement date, an impairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited\npartnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.\n•\nInvestment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-\nthan-temporary declines in fair value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real\nestate investment is considered held-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company\ngenerally estimates fair value using net operating income and applying a capitalization rate in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time\nof the sale, the difference between the sales price and the carrying value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss.\n•\nPrivately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments for\nobservable price changes.

Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder,\nnot the Company, assumes investment and other risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investment\nperformance on experience-rated products is allocated to contract holders’ accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does\nnot impact the Company’s net income (as long as the contract’s minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large case\npensions’ experience-rated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders’\naccounts through a charge to benefit costs. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected in policyholders’ funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are included\nas a component of net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an impairment\non property and equipment of $261 million in connection with the planned closure of certain retail stores. See Note 6 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information\nabout these impairment charges as well as the Company’s finance leases.\nRight-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an\nunderlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets\nand lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the\npresent value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company\nutilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also\ninclude lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives.\nThe Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to five years each. For real estate leases, the\noptions to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the\neconomic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the\nrenewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and\nlease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of\nbeing exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require\nadditional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as\nincurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and\ninsurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nSee",

These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair\nmarket values at the date of acquisition. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation\ntechniques and management estimates.\nThe Company’s definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the\nasset. Other than VOBA, definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. VOBA is amortized over the expected life of the acquired\ncontracts in proportion to estimated premiums. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if\nnecessary, as further described in “Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nSee Note 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about intangible assets.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using\nseparate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The\nCompany groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of\nimpairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group\n(undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is\nprepared.

The\nCompany estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying\namount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. During the third quarter of both\n2022 and 2020, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill and concluded there were no goodwill impairments as of the testing\ndates or during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020.

Accordingly, during the third quarter of 2021,\nthe Company recorded a $431 million goodwill impairment charge on the remaining goodwill of the LTC reporting unit. The results of the impairment tests\nindicated that there was no impairment of goodwill of the remaining reporting units as of the testing date or during the year ended December 31, 2021. See\nNote 5 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value.

In developing its IBNR estimate, the\nCompany consistently applies these actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been\nno significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of IBNR in 2022.\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to\nestimate “completion factors.” The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months\nbefore the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim\npayment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all\nclaims are paid within six months of the date of service, but it can take up to 48 months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are\ncompletely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the\nultimate claim cost for a given month’s incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the\nfinancial statement date represents the Company’s estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company’s\nhealth care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels,\nclaim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership\nand changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete\nthan originally estimated using the Company’s completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived\ncompletion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost\n119\n\n\nof claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for\nthe most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\nThe Company’s health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such\nservices.

The health status of the Company’s Insured\nmembers, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per\nmember utilization and unit costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of prescription drugs (including specialty\npharmacy drugs), direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory\nenvironment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company’s health care cost\ntrend rate.\nFor each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result,\nconsiderable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less\nbefore the financial statement date; and the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health\ncare cost trend rates. For each reporting period the Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential\nvolatility in assumed completion factors and health care cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs\npayable is reasonable and adequate to cover its obligations at December 31, 2022; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company’s estimates.

Reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts are based upon the\nCompany’s estimate of the present value of future benefits, which is based on assumed investment yields and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity and\nrecoveries from the U.S. Social Security Administration. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions which\nconsider, among other things, contractual requirements, claim incidence rates, claim recovery rates, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company\ndiscounts certain claim liabilities related to group long-term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contracts. The discount rates generally reflect the\nCompany’s expected investment returns for the investments supporting all incurral years of these liabilities. The discount rates for retrospectively-rated\ncontracts are set at contractually specified levels. The Company’s estimates of unpaid claims are subject to change due to changes in the underlying experience\nof the insurance contracts, changes in investment yields or other factors, and these changes are recorded in current and future benefits in the consolidated\nstatements of operations in the period they are determined. The Company estimates its reserve for claims IBNR for life products largely based on completion\nfactors. The completion factors used are based on the Company’s historical experience and reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as\nclaim inventory levels, claim payment patterns, changes in business volume and other factors. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace\nthan historical periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using completion factors, which may result in reserves that are\nhigher (lower) than required to cover future life benefit payments. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop\nthe Company’s estimate of unpaid claims IBNR in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, unpaid claims balances of $243 million and $1.1 billion were recorded in\nother insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, unpaid claims balances of $324 million and $1.3\nbillion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively.\n120\n\n\nSubstantially all life and disability insurance liabilities have been fully ceded to unrelated third parties through indemnity reinsurance agreements; however, the\nCompany remains directly obligated to the policyholders.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nFuture policy benefits consist primarily of reserves for limited payment pension and annuity con",

Reserves for\nlimited payment pension and annuity contracts are computed using actuarial principles that consider, among other things, assumptions reflecting anticipated\nmortality, retirement, expense and interest rate experience. Such assumptions generally vary by plan, year of issue and policy duration. Assumed interest rates\non such contracts ranged from 3.0% to 11.3% in both the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Company periodically reviews mortality assumptions\nagainst both industry standards and its experience. Reserves for long-duration long-term care contracts represent the Company’s estimate of the present value\nof future benefits and essential maintenance expenses to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future gross premiums. The assumed\ninterest rate on such contracts was 4.9% and 5.1% in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company’s estimate of the present value\nof future benefits under such contracts is based upon mortality, morbidity and interest rate assumptions. As of December 31, 2022, future policy benefits\nbalances of $385 million and $5.0 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. As of December 31,\n2021, future policy benefits balances of $416 million and $5.1 billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities,\nrespectively.\nPremium Deficiency Reserves\nThe Company evaluates its insurance contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred. A premium deficiency loss is recognized when it is\nprobable that expected future claims, including maintenance costs (for example, direct costs such as claim processing costs), will exceed existing reserves plus\nanticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries. Anticipated investment income is not considered in the calculation of premium deficiency losses for\nshort-duration contracts. For purposes of determining premium deficiency losses, contracts are grouped consistent with the Company’s method of acquiring,\nservicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. The Company did not have any premium deficiency reserves as of December 31, 2022. As of\nDecember 31, 2021, the Company established a premium deficiency reserve of $16 million related to Medicaid products in the Health Care Benefits segment.\nPolicyholders’ Funds\nPolicyholders’ funds consist primarily of reserves for pension and annuity investment contracts and customer funds associated with certain health contracts.\nReserves for such contracts are equal to cumulative deposits less withdrawals and charges plus interest credited thereon, net of experience-rated adjustments.

          "chunk": "ealth Care Benefits Segment\nHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings,\nwhich, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and the number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at\nthe time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Government\nbusiness is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility.\nThe Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known\nas retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As\ninformation regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the\nperiod in which they arise.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance\nfor estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements\nof the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”) is\nrecorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned\npremiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such\nadjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer\nemerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and\naccounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange\nfor performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided.

Each period the Company estimates its obligations\nunder the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.\nAccounting for Medicare Part D\nRevenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual\narrangements with the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”). The insurance\n122\n\n\npremiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members,\nand a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as\nrevenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable\nconsideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional\nsubsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income\ncost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference\nis recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\nPharmacy Services Segment\nThe Pharmacy Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its mail service dispensing pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail\npharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no\ncontractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in\ntime. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the\ndispensing of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the\nprescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members.

This standard requires the Company to review cash flow assumptions for its long-duration insurance contracts at least annually and recognize the\neffect of changes in future cash flow assumptions in net income. This standard also requires the Company to update discount rate assumptions quarterly and\nrecognize the effect of changes in these assumptions in other comprehensive income (loss). The rate used to discount the Company’s liability for future policy\nbenefits will be based on an estimate of the yield for an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument with a duration profile matching that of the Company’s\nliabilities. In addition, this standard changes the amortization method for deferred acquisition costs and requires additional disclosures regarding the long\nduration insurance contract liabilities in the Company’s interim and annual financial statements. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years,\nand interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company adopted this accounting standard on January 1, 2023, using the\nmodified retrospective transition method as of the earliest period presented, January 1, 2021, also referred to as the transition date, for changes primarily related\nto the liability for future policy benefits and deferred acquisition costs. The Company is still in the process of finalizing the impact of the new standard on its\nhistorical financial statements, but expects to record an increase to its liability for future policy benefits with a corresponding change in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income on the transition date of approximately $1 billion as a result of updating the rate used to discount the liabilities to reflect the yield for an\nupper-medium grade fixed-income instrument compared to the Company’s expected investment yield under the existing guidance.\n131\n\n\n2.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales\nProposed Oak Street Health Acquisition\nOn February 7, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Oak Street Health, Inc.

For some private placement securities, the Company’s internal staff determines the value of these debt\nsecurities by analyzing spreads of corporate and sector indices as well as interest spreads of comparable public bonds. Examples of these private\nplacement Level 3 debt securities include certain U.S. and foreign securities and certain tax-exempt municipal securities.\nEquity Securities – The Company currently has two classifications of equity securities: those that are publicly traded and those that are privately\nplaced. Publicly-traded equity securities are classified in Level 1 because quoted prices are available for these securities in an active market. For\nprivately placed equity securities, there is no active market; therefore, these securities are classified in Level 3 because the Company prices these\nsecurities through an internal analysis of each investment’s financial statements and cash flow projections.

Accordingly, in the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded office real estate optimization charges of\n$117 million, primarily consisting of $71 million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $44 million related to property and equipment, within the\nHealth Care Benefits, Corporate/Other and Pharmacy Services segments.\nStore Impairment Charges\nThe Company evaluates its retail store right-of-use and property and equipment assets for impairment at the retail store level, which is the lowest level at which\ncash flows can be identified. For retail stores where there is an indicator of impairment present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset\ngroup to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used in the analysis are\nless than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of\nthe asset group to its estimated fair value which is the greater of the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted), or the consideration of what a\nmarket participant would pay to lease the assets, net of leasing costs. The Company’s estimate of fair value considers historical results, current operating trends,\nconsolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. For assets which the Company has determined it will be able to sublease, the estimated\nfuture cash flows include the estimated sublease income, net of estimated leasing costs.\nWhen the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the value of the asset group to its estimated\nfair value. As the impaired assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using unobservable inputs as of the measurement date, the assets\nare classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and announced the creation of new formats for its stores to\ncontinue to drive higher engagement with customers. As part of this review, the Company evaluated changes in population, consumer buying patterns and\nfuture health needs to ensure it has the right kinds of stores in the right locations for consumers and for the business. In connection with this initiative, on\nNovember 17, 2021, the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation (the “Board”) authorized the closing of approximately 900 retail stores, approximately\n300 stores each year, between 2022 and 2024. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’\nasset groups, including the associated operating lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment.

Payment of such annual incentive and long-term performance awards will be in cash, stock, other awards or other property, at the\ndiscretion of the Management Planning and Development Committee (the “MP&D Committee”) of the Board. The ICP allows for a maximum of 58 million\nshares of CVS Health Corporation common stock to be reserved and available for grants. As of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 21 million\nshares of CVS Health Corporation common stock available for future grants under the ICP.\nUpon the acquisition of Aetna (the “Aetna Acquisition”) on November 28, 2018, approximately 22 million shares of Aetna common stock subject to awards\noutstanding under the Amended Aetna Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (“SIP”) were assumed by CVS Health Corporation. In addition, in accordance with the\nmerger agreement, shares which were available for future issuance under the SIP were converted into approximately 32 million shares of CVS Health\nCorporation common stock reserved and available for issuance pursuant to future awards. Subsequent to the expiration of the SIP on May 21, 2020, the ICP\nwas the only compensation plan under which the Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to its employees.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of\nthe stock award (generally three to five years) using the straight-line method.

The fair\nvalue of the restricted stock units is based on the market price of CVS Health Corporation common stock on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the vesting period. For each restricted stock unit granted, employees receive one share of common stock, net of taxes, at the end of the vesting\nperiod.\nThe Company’s performance stock units contain performance vesting conditions in addition to a service vesting condition. Vesting of the Company’s\nperformance stock units is dependent upon the degree to which the Company achieves its performance goals, which are generally set for a three-year\nperformance period and are approved at the time of grant by the MP&D Committee.\nThe fair value of performance stock units granted with service and performance vesting conditions is based on the market price of CVS Health Corporation\ncommon stock on the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period. Certain of the performance stock units also contain a market vesting condition based\non the performance of CVS Health Corporation common stock relative to a comparator group. The fair value of these performance stock units is determined\nusing a Monte Carlo simulation as of the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $619 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock units and performance\nstock units that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. The total fair value of restricted\nstock units vested during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $328 million, $406 million and $229 million, respectively.\nThe following table is a summary of the restricted stock unit and performance stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nIn thousands, except weighted average grant date fair value\nUnits\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding at beginning of year, nonvested\n14,330  $\n63.02 \nGranted\n5,398  $\n101.13 \nVested \n(5,626) $\n58.28 \nForfeited\n(1,421) $\n72.76 \nOutstanding at end of year, nonvested\n12,681  $\n80.25 \n(1)\nVested performance stock units have been included at target level performance.

The Company believes COVID-19’s impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial\ncondition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic; the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. and global\neconomies and consumer behavior and health care utilization patterns; and the timing, scope and impact of legislation as well as other federal, state and local\ngovernmental responses to the pandemic. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will\nhave on the Company’s businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material. COVID-\n19 also may result in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations and claims against the Company.\nGuarantees\nThe Company has the following significant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2022:\n•\nASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The\nbanks maintain accounts to fund claims of the Company’s ASC customers. The customer is responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day.\nIn these arrangements, the Company guarantees that the banks will not sustain losses if the responsible ASC customer does not properly fund its account.\nThe aggregate maximum exposure under these arrangements is generally limited to $250 million. The Company can limit its exposure to these guarantees\nby suspending the payment of claims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded the amount paid by the bank.\n•\nSeparate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent\nfunds maintained as a contractual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations\nunderlying the guaranteed benefits in these Separate Accounts were approximately $941 million and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and\nmortality risk and are required to maintain Separate Accounts balances at or above a specified level.

As a result, the Company was not required to maintain any additional liability for its related guarantees at\nDecember 31, 2022.\nLease Guarantees\nBetween 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob’s Stores and Linens ‘n Things, each of which subsequently\nfiled for bankruptcy, and Marshalls. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the former subsidiary’s lease\nobligations for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. When\nthe subsidiaries were disposed of and accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company’s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser\nagreed to indemnify the Company for any lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries fail\nto make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy those obligations, and any significant adverse impact of COVID-\n19 on such purchasers and/or former subsidiaries increases the risk that the Company will be required to satisfy those obligations. As of December 31, 2022,\nthe Company guaranteed 67 such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens ‘n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the\nconsolidated balance sheets), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2034.\nGuaranty Fund Assessments, Market Stabilization and Other Non-Voluntary Risk Sharing Pools\nUnder guaranty fund laws existing in all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (in most states up to prescribed limits) for certain\nobligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the Company\nparticipates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers and life insurers as well as health insurers. The Company’s\nassessments generally are based on a formula relating to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers. Certain\nstates allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors such as\nnot-for-profit consumer-governed health plans established under the ACA.\nIn 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries\n(collectively, “Penn Treaty”) in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and subsequently petitioned a state court to convert the rehabilitation\ninto a liquidation.

The Company establishes liabilities for these\nassessments based on applicable laws and regulations. In certain states, the ultimate assessments the Company pays are dependent upon the Company’s\nexperience relative to other entities subject to the assessment, and the ultimate liability is not known at the financial statement date.

The Company collects claim and encounter data from providers and generally relies on providers to appropriately code their submissions to the\nCompany and document their medical records, including the diagnosis data submitted to the Company with claims. CMS pays increased premiums to Medicare\nAdvantage plans and Medicare PDP plans for members who have certain medical conditions identified with specific diagnosis codes. Federal regulators review\nand audit the providers’ medical records to determine whether those records support the related diagnosis codes that determine the members’ health status and\nthe resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the Company. In that regard, CMS has instituted risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”) audits of various\nMedicare Advantage plans, including certain of the Company’s plans, to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained by\nproviders and the resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the plans. CMS may require the Company to refund premium payments if the Company’s risk-\nadjusted premiums are not properly supported by medical record data. The Office of the Inspector General of the HHS (the “OIG”) also is auditing the\nCompany’s risk adjustment-related data and that of other companies. The Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue these types of audits.\nIn 2012, in the “Notice of Final Payment Error Calculation for Part C Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustm",

Under the revised methodology, among other things, CMS announced extrapolation of the error rate identified in the audit sample along with the\napplication of a process to account for errors in the government’s traditional fee-for-service Medicare program (“FFS Adjuster”). For contract years prior to\n2011, CMS did not extrapolate sample error rates to the entire contract, nor did CMS propose to apply a FFS adjuster. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare\nAdvantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent that their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original\nMedicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare Advantage organizations are subject. This revised contract-level audit\nmethodology increased the Company’s exposure to premium refunds to CMS based on incomplete medical records maintained by providers. In the RADV\naudit methodology CMS used from 2011-2013, CMS selected only a few of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contracts for various contract years for\ncontract-level RADV audits. In October 2018, CMS in the proposed rule (“Proposed Rule”) announced a new methodology for RADV audits targeting certain\nhealth conditions and members with many diagnostic conditions along with extrapolation for the error rates identified without use of a FFS Adjuster. While the\nrule was under proposal, CMS initiated contract-level RADV audits for the years 2014 and 2015 with this new RADV methodology without a final rule.\nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule (“RADV Audit Rule”), announcing it may use extrapolation for payment years 2018 forward, for both\nRADV audits and OIG audits and eliminated the application of a FFS Adjuster in Part C contract-level RADV audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. In\nthe RADV Audit Rule, CMS indicated that it will use more than one audit methodology going forward and indicated CMS will audit contracts it believes are at\nthe highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling, citing a 2016 Governmental Accountability Office report that recommended selection of\ncontract-level RADV audits with a focus on contracts likely to have high rates of improper payment, the highest coding intensity scores, and contracts with\nhigh levels of unsupported diagnoses from prior RADV audits.\nThe Company is currently unable to predict which of its Medicare Advantage contracts will be selected for future audit, the amounts of any retroactive refunds\nfor years prior to 2018 or prospective adjustments to Medicare Advantage premium payments made to the Company, the effect of any such refunds or\nadjustments on the actuarial soundness of the Company’s Medicare Advantage bids, or whether any RADV audit findings would requir",

The Company’s\nsegments maintain separate financial information, and the Company’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results\non a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance.

See the reconciliation of consolidated operating income (GAAP measure) to consolidated adjusted operating income below for further context\nregarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The Company uses adjusted operating income as its principal\nmeasure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying\nbusiness performance and trends.

The Charter provides for a majority\nvote standard for uncontested elections of directors, and a plurality of votes standard for contested elections of directors. Subject to any rights of any\noutstanding series of preferred stock or preference stock, (i) the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to such dividends as may be declared from time\nto time by the board from funds available therefor, (ii) no dividends may be declared, paid, or set aside for payment on shares of common stock unless full\ncumulative dividends are paid on any outstanding preference stock and any other preferred stock issued and outstanding at such time that is designated to have\nsuch dividend preference and (iii) upon dissolution the holders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive pro rata all assets of CVS Health available for\ndistribution to such holders, subject to any liquidation preferences designated to any preferred stock or preference stock that may be issued and outstanding at\nsuch time of liquidation.\nNo Preemptive Rights\nThe Charter provides that no holder of any shares of CVS Health of any class or series may have any preemptive right to purchase or subscribe to any\nshares of CVS Health or any security convertible into shares of CVS Health of any class or series.\nProvisions Relating to Amendments to CVS Health’s Charter and By-Laws\nUnder Delaware law, stockholders have the right to adopt, amend or repeal the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of a corporation. However,\nDelaware law requires that any amendment to the Charter also be approved by the board. Under Delaware law, unless a higher vote is required in a\ncorporation’s certificate of incorporation, amendments to the corporation’s certificate of incorporation will be adopted upon receiving at a properly convened\nmeeting the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and if any class or series is entitled to vote thereon as a\nclass, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast in each class vote.\nIn addition, the By-Laws may be amended by the board with respect to all matters not exclusively",
