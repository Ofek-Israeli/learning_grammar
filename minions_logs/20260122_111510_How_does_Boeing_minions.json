Total length: 510540 characters.: \n\n## Question\nHow does Boeing's effective tax rate in FY2022 compare to FY2021?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 510540 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To address the question about Boeing's effective tax rate comparison between FY2022 and FY2021, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. Identify the sections that discuss the income tax expense or benefit, as well as any notes or commentary on tax rates. Look for the effective tax rate percentages for both fiscal years, which are typically found in the income statement or the notes to the financial statements. Pay attention to any explanations or factors that might have influenced changes in the tax rate, such as tax law changes, adjustments, or one-time items. This information will provide a clear comparison of the effective tax rates for the two fiscal years."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Non-U.S. companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group continue to build a\nstrategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. In addition,\ncertain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements.

We work with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not\nlimited to, all of the branches of the U.S. military, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Federal Aviation Administration\n(FAA) and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our non-U.S. markets.\nGovernment Contracts. The U.S. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as\nwell as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. If any of our U.S. government contracts were to be\nterminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation\ncosts. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. government would pay only for the work that has\nbeen accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of\nthe work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\nCommercial Aircraft. In the U.S., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with FAA regulations governing production and quality\nsystems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. New aircraft models and new derivative\naircraft are required to obtain FAA certification prior to entry into service. Outside the U.S., similar requirements exist for airworthiness,\ninstallation and operational approvals. These requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in\nthe case of Europe, coordinated by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency.\nEnvironmental.

The commercial aircraft market is\npredominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are\nsustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further\ninfluenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological\nadvances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the\nairline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost\ncompetitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of\nour major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual\norders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In\naddition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these\nmacroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost\noverruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years\nbefore the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing\ngenerally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our\nrevenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of\nour control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues\nand operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will\nexercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us.

The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and\nthe 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a\ntype certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircraft’s flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were\nsubmitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting\nspecifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft\nmust include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in\nBoeing’s application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning\nthree years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety\nenhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have\nprovisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience\ndelays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be\nadversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies\noutside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs.

We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787\naircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane\ndeliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers\nhaving the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.\nWe must minimize disruption caused by production changes, achieve operational stability and implement productivity improvements in order to\nmeet customer demand and maintain our profitability. We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our\ncommercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023.\nProduction of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023.

Levels of U.S. defense spending are very difficult to predict and may be impacted by numerous factors such\nas the evolving nature of the national security threat environment, U.S. national security strategy, U.S. foreign policy, the domestic political\nenvironment, macroeconomic conditions and the ability of the U.S. government to enact relevant legislation such as authorization and\nappropriations bills.\nThe timeliness of FY24 and future appropriations for government departments and agencies remains a recurrent risk.

Business\nconducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.\nOur sales to the U.S. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs.\nNew procurement regulations or climate or cyber-related contractual disclosures, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our\ncompliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our BDS and BGS businesses. These requirements may also\nresult in withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply. For example, proposals to raise domestic content thresholds for\nour U.S. government contracts could have negative impacts on our business. Compliance costs attributable to current and potential future\nprocurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe U.S. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts.

Any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification,\ncurtailment or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations\nand/or cash flows.\nWe are subject to U.S. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under U.S.\ngovernment contracts.

New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the\nperiod of contract performance. The long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-\nprice contracts inherently risky. Fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance, which can be difficult to\nestimate and have significant impacts on margins. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and\nperformance.\nEstimating costs to complete fixed-price development contracts is generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts.\nMany of these development programs have highly complex designs. In addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could\nlead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial\ncondition. Examples of significant BDS fixed-price development contracts include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk,\nVC-25B Presidential Aircraft, and commercial and military satellites.\nWe enter into cost-type contracts, which also carry risks.\nOur BDS and BGS defense businesses generated approximately 40% and 31% of their 2022 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements.\nSome of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. These cost-type programs typically have award\nor incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. In these cases the associated financial risks are\nprimarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Programs whose\ncontracts are primarily cost-type include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\nWe enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.\nContracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. These in-orbit\npayments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. In both cases, the in-orbit\nincentive payment is at risk if the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. The net present value of in-orbit\nincentive fees  we ultimately expect to realize  is recognized as revenue in the construction period.

As cyber\nthreats increase in volume and sophistication, the risk to the security of these systems and networks – and to the confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability of the data they house – continues to evolve, requiring constant vigilance and concerted, company-wide risk management efforts.\nA cyberattack or security breach, whether experienced directly or through our supply chain, could, among other serious consequences, result in\nloss of intellectual property; unauthorized access to various categories of sensitive, proprietary or customer data; disruption or degradation of\nbusiness operations, or compromise of products or services. To address these risks, we maintain an extensive network of technical security\ncontrols, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight. We also have established a Cybersecurity\nGovernance Council to strengthen governance and coordination of cybersecurity activities. While these measures are designed to prevent,\ndetect and respond to unauthorized activity, there is no guarantee that they will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the risk of a cyberattack or the\npotentially serious reputational, operational, or financial impacts that may result. In November 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity incident that\nimpacted certain systems of Jeppesen, a wholly owned Boeing subsidiary that provides flight planning and navigation services. We determined\nthat the incident posed no risk to flight safety. We promptly notified law enforcement, regulatory authorities and customers, launched an\ninvestigation, and took additional steps to protect the integrity of our systems. While this incident has not had a material impact on us, future\nincidents like this one could have material impact on our business, operations, and reputation.\nIn addition, we manage information and information technology systems for certain customers and/or suppliers. Many of these customers and/or\nsuppliers face similar security threats. If we were unable to protect against the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers’\nand/or suppliers’ confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial or\nother losses.\nBusiness disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.\nOur business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security or our information technology systems, extreme weather\n(including effects of climate change) or other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises.

A number of factors could cause us to incur increased\nborrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the\nglobal capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings and/or changes in demand for our products and\nservices.

We estimate\nfuture contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a\nsignificant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity.

BGS provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive and cost-competitive product and\nservice solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nDomestic travel continues to recover from the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic before international travel and the narrow-body\nmarket continues to follow domestic travel recovery, while the wide-body market continues to be paced by international travel recovery. The pace\nof the commercial market recovery remains impacted by government restrictions related to COVID-19, especially China. We are seeing a strong\nrecovery in travel demand for our airline customers in North and South America, the Middle East, and Europe, and demand for dedicated\nfreighters continues to be underpinned by a strong recovery in global trade.\nWe and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply chain constraints,\nand labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the\nsupply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of\noperations and cash flows.\nAirline financial performance, which influences demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to\nthe International Air Transport Association (IATA), net losses for the airline industry were $138 billion in 2020 and $42 billion in 2021. IATA also\nforecasts $6.9 billion of losses for the industry globally in 2022, with approximately $9.9 billion of profits in North America driven by the robust\ndomestic market being more than offset by losses in other regions. For 2023, IATA is forecasting $4.6 billion in profits for the industry globally.\nWhile the outlook continues to improve, we continue to face a challenging environment in the near- to medium-term as airlines are facing\nincreased fuel and other costs, and the global economy is experiencing high inflation. The current environment is also affecting the financial\nviability of some airlines.\n20\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing\npropensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between\ncountries. Our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 3.8% growth rate for passenger and cargo traffic over a 20-year period. Based on\nlong-term global ",

The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market\nshocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental regulations.\nDuring 2022, commercial services volume at BGS recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We expect BGS commercial revenues to remain strong in\nfuture quarters as the commercial airline industry continues to recover. The demand outlook for our government services business remains\nstable.\nAt BDS, we continue to see stable demand reflecting the important role our products and services have in ensuring our national security. Outside\nof the U.S., we are seeing similar solid demand as governments prioritize security, defense technology and global cooperation given evolving\nthreats. We continue to experience near-term production disruptions and inefficiencies due to supplier disruption, labor instability and factory\nperformance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on a number of fixed-price development programs which are\nexpected to adversely affect cash flows in future periods.\nAs a result of the war in Ukraine, we recorded earnings charges totaling $212 million during the first quarter of 2022, primarily related to asset\nimpairments. We have closed our facilities in Russia. We are focused on the safety of our employees and retaining the strength of our\nengineering talent through voluntary transfers to other countries. We have also suspended our business in Russia, including parts, maintenance\nand technical support for Russian airlines, and purchases from Russian suppliers. We are complying with U.S. and international sanctions and\nexport control restrictions. We have sufficient material and parts to avoid production disruptions in the near-term, but future impacts to our\nproduction from disruptions in our supply chain are possible.

The commercial aircraft\nmarket and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts and responses have varied globally, the reduction of\ndemand and disruption in production has adversely impacted most manufacturers in the commercial aircraft industry.\nContinued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately\n70% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are\nintent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The\ngrounding of the 737 MAX in 2019 and the associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries in multiple jurisdictions significantly reduced our market\nshare with respect to deliveries of single aisle aircraft and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase\nmarket share. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the\nacquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental\nmarket. Other competitors are also in different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft, including Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China,\nLtd.

The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to\nprice and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASC 606.\nBCA total backlog of $329,824 million at December 31, 2022 increased from $296,882 million at December 31, 2021, reflecting new orders in\nexcess of deliveries and price escalation, offset by order cancellations and by an increase in the value of existing orders that in our assessment\ndo not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31,\n2022 totaled $11,251 million and relate to 737 and 787 aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted in\na decrease to backlog of $4,675 million primarily due to a net increase of 777X aircraft in the ASC 606 reserve, partially offset by net decreases\nin 737 and 787 aircraft in the ASC 606 reserve.

Additionally, beginning one year\nafter the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft must include certain safety enhancements to be issued an\noriginal airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in Boeing’s application for the certification for the 737-10, and\nthe sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning three years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-\n10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is\nrequired to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have provisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety\nenhancements and do not expect those costs to be material.\nWe are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process, and currently expect the 737-7 to be certified and delivered in\n2023, and the 737-10 to begin FAA certification flight testing in 2023 with first delivery in in 2024.

We are currently producing at a combined production rate of 3 per month for the\n777/777X programs. The accounting quantity for the 777X program increased by 50 units during 2022 reflecting the launch of the 777X-8\nfreighter during the first quarter of 2022. First delivery of the 777X-8 freighter is expected in 2027.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X-9, previously expected in late 2023, and now expect it\nwill occur in 2025, based on an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements. We are working towards Type\nInspection Authorization (TIA) which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification will ultimately be\ndetermined by the regulators, and further determinations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in\nentry into service and/or additional cost increases.\nIn April 2022, we decided to pause production of the 777X-9 during 2022 and 2023. We implemented the production pause during the second\nquarter of 2022, and it is expected to result in abnormal production costs of approximately $1.5 billion that are being expensed as incurred until\n777X-9 production resumes. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $0.3 billion of abnormal costs were period expensed.\n32\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe 777X program had near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2022.

In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that\nproduction rates below 5 per month represented abnormally low production rates and result in abnormal production costs. We also determined\nthat the inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that\nare required to be expensed as incurred. Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through December 31, 2022 totaled $1.7 billion. During the fourth\nquarter of 2022 we adjusted the total estimate of abnormal production costs up to $2.8 billion with most being incurred by the end of 2023. At\nDecember 31, 2021, we were expecting to incur approximately $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis. The increase was\nprimarily driven by a decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 to slow down near-term production due to supply chain constraints and increased\ninspection and rework costs. We continue to work with customers and suppliers regarding timing of future deliveries and production rate\nchanges.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other\nactions required to resume 787 deliveries, taking longer than expected.

The timing of\ncertifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.\nAdditional Considerations\nThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with\nsuppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as\nthose of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In\naddition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting\ndevelopment, production and certification schedules. These challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in\nthe wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or\nmaintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an\nairplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity,\ncustomer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic\nindicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or\nadding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory\nrequirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for\nnew airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe\nthe cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane\nprograms creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which\ncould trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\nDefense, Space & Security\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nUnited States Government Defense Environment Overview\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, enacted in December 2022, provided fiscal year 2023 (FY23) appropriations for government\ndepartments and agencies, including $817 billion for the U.S. DoD and $25.4 billion for NASA.

Cumulative\ncontract catch-up adjustments in 2022 were $1,858 million more unfavorable than the prior year largely due to charges on development\nprograms.\nBDS revenues in 2021 increased by $283 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program due to\nnew orders for 27 aircraft received during the first quarter of 2021 and lower charges in 2021. This was partially offset by lower revenues on\nrotorcraft programs, Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than\nthe prior year, largely due to the lower charges described below.\n(Loss)/earnings From Operations\nBDS loss from operations in 2022 of $3,544 million decreased by $5,088 million compared with earnings from operations of $1,544 million in\n2021 primarily due to unfavorable impacts of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments ($4,284 million more unfavorable in 2022 than 2021).\nVolume and mix and higher research and development also contributed to the year over year earnings decline.

These were partially offset by charges on the KC-46A Tanker ($402 million), VC-25B ($318 million), and Commercial Crew ($214\nmillion) recognized in 2021.

Some of these programs\nhave cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or\nprogram cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse\nDefense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include\nCommercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price\ndevelopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during\nthe period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during\ndevelopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our\nestimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are\nongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of\nthese programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended,\nwhich could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional\nreach-forward losses in future periods.\nGlobal Services\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades;\ntraining and professional services; and data analytics and digital services. During 2022, commercial services volume at BGS recovered to pre-\npandemic levels. We expect BGS commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry continues to\nrecover.\nOver the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to\nincrease efficiency and extend the economic lives of aircraft. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive\nmaintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts\ninventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.\nThe demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2022",

The 364-day credit\nfacility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration\ndate. We anticipate that these credit lines will remain undrawn and primarily serve as back-up liquidity to support our general corporate\nborrowing needs.\nOur increased debt balance resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings in 2020, and our ratings remained unchanged in 2022 and 2021. We\nexpect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our\nbusiness related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements. A number of factors\ncould cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors\ninclude disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, and/or\nassociated changes in demand for our products and services. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating\ndowngrades.

Our long-term contracts typically represent a single\ndistinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the\nsignificant service of integration that we provide.\nAccounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation.\nCost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount\nreported as cost of sales.\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is\ncomplicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our\nassumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price\nadjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the\nprice is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the\ntypes of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase\ncontract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include\ninflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization,\nanticipated labor agreements, and lingering impacts of COVID-19.\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in\nthese estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost\nof sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward\nloss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings.

The\ncumulative catch-up adjustments in 2022 were primarily due to losses recognized on the VC-25B, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, Commercial Crew\nand T-7A Red Hawk programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be\nrecognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if\nwe used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, internal and\nsupplier performance, inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the\ncombined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2022, it would have\nincreased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.\nProgram Accounting\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program\naccounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-\nterm production effort for\n48\n\n\nTable of Contents\ndelivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably\ndependable estimates.\nFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part\ncosts, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting\nquantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders,\nletters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and\nsales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The\nsales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly.

This includes\nreassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis;\nhowever, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a\nloss is recorded in the current period.

Adverse changes to the revenue and/or\ncost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods.\n777X Program The 777X program had near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2022. The level of profitability on the 777X program will\nbe subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption,\ncustomer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting\nquantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in\nadditional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material.\n787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the 787 program primarily due to rework driving longer\ndelivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased the 787\nprogram accounting quantity by 100 units due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft.

Tax law determines\nwhether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The\nparticular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of\nthe related asset or settlement of the related liability.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income\nand reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely\nthan not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.\nThis assessment takes into account both positive and negative evidence.

The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior\nto maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. As of December 31, 2022, we do not\nhave any significant floating-rate debt obligations.

These statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest\nentities that are required to be consolidated. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As described in Note\n22, we operate in four reportable segments: Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), Global Services (BGS) and Boeing\nCapital (BCC).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\nOperating Cycle\nFor classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use t",

For each contract, we\ndetermine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction price to each commercial\naircraft performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer\nagreement. Revenue is recognized for each commercial aircraft performance obligation at the point in time when the aircraft is completed and\naccepted by the customer. We use program accounting to determine the amount reported as cost of sales.\nPayments for commercial aircraft sales are received in accordance with the customer agreement, which generally includes a deposit upon order\nand additional payments in accordance with a payment schedule, with the balance being due immediately prior to or at aircraft delivery.\nAdvances and progress billings (contract liabilities) are normal and customary for commercial aircraft contracts and not considered a significant\nfinancing component as they are intended to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the\ncontract.\nLong-term contracts Substantially all contracts at BDS and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and\nother customers that generally extend over several years. Products sales under long-term contracts primarily include fighter jets, rotorcraft,\ncybersecurity products, surveillance suites, advanced weapons, missile defense, military derivative aircraft, satellite systems and modification of\ncommercial passenger aircraft to cargo freighters. Sales of services under long-term contracts primarily include support and maintenance\nagreements associated with our commercial and defense products and space travel on Commercial Crew.\n59\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor each long-term contract, we determine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. We allocate the transaction\nprice to each distinct performance obligation to deliver a good or service, or a collection of goods and/or services, based on the relative\nstandalone selling prices. A long-term contract will typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent\nand interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.

Long-term contracts can be negotiated with a fixed price or a price in which\nwe are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that\nwill be reimbursed in establishing the price for contracts with the U.S. government. Certain long-term contracts include in the transaction price\nvariable consideration, such as incentive and award fees, if specified targets are achieved. The amount included in the transaction price\nrepresents the expected value, based on a weighted probability, or the most likely amount.\nLong-term contract revenue is recognized over the contract term (over time) as the work progresses, either as products are produced or as\nservices are rendered. We generally recognize revenue over time as we perform on long-term contracts because of continuous transfer of\ncontrol to the customer. For U.S. government contracts, this continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in the\ncontract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience, pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit and take\ncontrol of any work in process. Similarly, for non-U.S. government contracts, the customer typically controls the work in process as evidenced\neither by contractual termination clauses or by our rights to payment of the transaction price associated with work performed to date on products\nor services that do not have an alternative use to the Company.\nThe accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales, costs and profit for each performance obligation.\nCost of sales is recognized as incurred. The amount reported as revenues is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated\nprofit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Recognizing revenue as costs are incurred provides an objective measure of progress on the long-\nterm contract and thereby best depicts the extent of transfer of control to the customer.\nFor long-term contracts for which revenue is recognized over time, changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on\noperating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the\nchanges on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion. When the current estimates of total revenues\nand costs at completion for a long-term contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire reach-forward loss on the long-term contract is\nrecognized.\nThe table below reflects the impact of net cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all\nlong-term contracts including the impact to Loss from operations from increases in estimated losses on unexercised options for the years ended\nDecember 31:\n2022\n2021\n2020\nDecrease to Revenue\n($2,335)\n($379)\n($",

The U.S. government customer typically withholds\npayment of a small portion of the contract price until contract completion. Therefore, long-term contracts typically generate Unbilled receivables\n(contract assets) but may generate Advances and progress billings (contract liabilities). Long-term contract Unbilled receivables and Advances\nand progress billings are not considered a significant financing component because they are intended to protect either the customer or the\nCompany in the event that some or all of the obligations under the contract are not completed.\nCommercial spare parts contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment include sales of commercial spare parts. For each contract, we\ndetermine the transaction price based on the consideration expected to be received. The spare parts have discrete unit prices that represent fair\nvalue. We generally consider each spare part to be a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized for each commercial spare part\nperformance obligation at the point in time of delivery to the customer. We may provide our customers with a right to return a commercial spare\npart where a customer may receive a full or partial refund, a credit applied to amounts owed, a different product in exchange, or any combination\nof these items. We consider the potential for customer returns in the estimated transaction price. The amount reported as cost of sales is\nrecorded at average cost. Payments for commercial spare parts sales are typically received shortly after delivery.\nOther service revenue contracts Certain contracts at our BGS segment are for sales of services to commercial customers including\nmaintenance, training, data analytics and information-based services. We recognize revenue for these service performance obligations over time\nas the services are rendered. The method of measuring progress (such as straight-line or billable amount) varies depending upon which method\nbest depicts the transfer of control to the customer based on the type of service performed. Cost of sales is recorded as incurred.\nConcession sharing arrangements We account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and\nservices as a reduction of the transaction price and the revenue that is recognized for the related performance oblig",

We record these\nreimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendor’s products or services, as a reduction in Cost of\nproducts.\nUnbilled receivables and advances and progress billings Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the Company recognizes\nrevenue for amounts which cannot yet be billed under terms of the contract with the customer. Advances and progress billings (contract\nliabilities) arise when the Company receives payments from customers in advance of recognizing revenue. The amount of Unbilled receivables\nor Advances and progress billings is determined for each contract.\nFinancial services revenue We record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases and loans in\nSales of services on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For sales-type leases, we recognize selling profit or loss at lease inception if\ncollection of the lease payments is probable. For sales-type and direct finance leases, we record customer financing receivables at lease\ninception. A customer financing receivable is recorded at the aggregate of future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the\nleased equipment, and any deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to\napproximate a level rate of return on the net investment. For notes receivable, we record customer financing receivables net of any unamortized\ndiscounts and deferred incremental direct costs. Interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of\nthe note.\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIncome recognition is generally suspended for customer financing receivables that are uncollectible. We determine that a customer financing\nreceivable is uncollectible when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according\nto the original contractual terms. We determine a customer financing receivable is past due when cash has not been received upon the due date\nspecified in the contract.\nWe evaluate the collectability of customer financing receivables at commencement and on a recurring basis. If a customer financing receivable is\ndetermined to be uncollectible, the customer is categorized as non-accrual status. When a customer is in non-accrual status at commencement,\nsales-type lease revenue is deferred until substantially all cash has been received or the customer is removed from non-accrual status. If we\nhave a direct finance lease and/or a note receivable with a customer that is in non-accrual status, or a sales-type lease with a customer that\nchanges to non-accrual status after commencement, we recognize contractual interest income as payments are received to the extent there is\nsufficient collateral and paym",

Operating lease\nassets, included in Customer financing, net, are recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value using the straight-line method\nover the period that we project we will hold the asset.

Costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized,\nconsistent with our long-term contract accounting policy.

Such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and\nexpense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. Significant judgment is required\nin determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.\nThe accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of\ntax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. We record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured\nfor financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. To the extent that our assessment of such\ntax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. Tax-related interest and penalties are\nclassified as a component of Income tax (expense)/benefit.\nWe also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the\ncarrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that all\nor a portion of such assets will not be realized.

The adequacy of these allowances is assessed quarterly through consideration of factors such as customer credit ratings,\nbankruptcy filings, published or estimated credit default rates, age of the receivable, expected loss rates and collateral exposures. Collateral\nexposure is the excess of the carrying value of a financial asset over the fair value of the related collateral. We determine the creditworthiness of\nour customers by assigning internal credit ratings based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from the\ncustomers.

Estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product delivery\noccurs. The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for\nproducts delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues\nthat exceed a normal claims level. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.\nWe provide guarantees to certain commercial aircraft customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft\nperformance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on\nknown and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified\nperformance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction\nof revenue at delivery of the related aircraft.

The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible\namounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities relate primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions. From a U.S. federal tax perspective, the Company generated a tax\nNOL in 2020 that was carried back to prior years when the tax rate was 35% due to the CARES Act benefit as described above. The Company\ngenerated tax NOL in 2021 and interest carryovers in 2021 and 2022 that can be carried forward indefinitely and federal research and\ndevelopment credits that can be carried forward 20 years.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020 and throughout 2021 and 2022, the Company was in a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. We also\nnormalized earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) for certain non-recurring items and reached a normalized three-year cumulative\nloss position in 2021. Adjustments to normalize earnings included non-recurring items for certain 737 MAX expenses, an agreement with the\nDepartment of Justice, severance costs and remeasurement gains and losses from the annual remeasurement of pension and other\npostretirement benefit obligations. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company determined that it could not\ninclude future projected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recorded valuation allowances of $3,162 and $2,423 primarily for certain federal deferred\ntax assets, as well as for certain federal and state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. To measure the valuation allowance, the\nCompany estimated in what year each of its deferred tax assets and liabilities would reverse using systematic and logical methods to estimate\nthe reversal patterns. Based on these methods, deferred tax liabilities are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next 5 to\n10 years while deferred tax assets related to pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are assumed to reverse and generate tax\ndeductions over the next 15 to 20 years. The valuation allowance primarily results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability\nreversals in the appropriate future periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets.\nThe increase in the valuation allowance during 2022 is primarily due to tax credits and other carryforwards generated in 2022 that cannot be\nrealized in 2022. During 2022, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $739. This reflects a tax expense of $1,199 recorded in\ncontinuing operations and an increase of $18 related to the associated federal benefit of state impacts.

Risk remains that we\nmay record additional losses in future periods.\n86\n\n\nTable of Contents\nKC-46A Tanker\nIn 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers\nas well as priced options for 13 annual production lots totaling 179 aircraft. This EMD contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract and involves\nhighly complex designs and systems integration. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized eight low rate initial production (LRIP) lots for a total of\n109 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $21 billion as of December 31, 2022.

The increase in production costs was primarily driven by factory unit time performance expectations that assume continued\nproduction disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption. Factory unit time estimates also reflect reduced benefits from prior\ninvestments in productivity enablers and higher factory unit time to produce aircraft for the remaining life of the program. The current year losses\nalso reflect increased estimated change incorporation costs for flight test aircraft as well as schedule delays to complete the Remote Vision\nSystem.

We also increased costs\nassociated with engineering design challenges, additional testing and certification activities, and flight test support.

The first production and support contract option is expected to be exercised in 2024. We increased the estimated reach-forward loss\nby $552 during the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily driven by ongoing supply chain negotiations (which are impacted by supply chain\nconstraints and inflationary pressures), and design revisions, as well as an increase in the number of expected units in the initial production lots.\nRisk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.

Our repurchase of the aircraft is contingent upon entering into a mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of\nadditional new aircraft in the future. The commercial aircraft repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower\nthan the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower\nof the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.\nIf a future sale agreement is reached and a customer elects to exercise its right under a contingent repurchase commitment, the contingent\nrepurchase commitment becomes a trade-in commitment.

The expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan\nyear is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (MRVA). Since our\nadoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the MRVA based on a five-year moving average of plan assets.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the MRVA was approximately $10,131 more than the fair market value of assets.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:\nDecember 31,\n2022\n2021\n2020\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed next year\n5.50 %\n4.50 %\n4.50 %\nUltimate trend rate\n4.50 %\n4.50 %\n4.50 %\nYear that trend reaches ultimate rate\n2028\n2021\n2021\n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPlan Assets\nInvestment Strategy The overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the\npension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. Specific investment\nobjectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a\ncompetitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. Investment objectives\nfor each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.\nWe periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. We use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan\nliability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. A key element of\nour strategy is to de-risk the plan as the funded status of the plan increases. During 2022, the funded status of the plans increased as compared\nto 2021, and additional assets were reallocated to fixed income. The changes in the asset allocation are reflected in the table below. We identify\ninvestment benchmarks to evaluate performance for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable\nwhere possible. Actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value\nfluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions.\nShort-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. The\nasset allocation is monitored and rebalanced frequently. The actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at December 31\nwere as follows:\nActual Allocations\nTarget Allocations\nAsset Class\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nFixed income\n63 %\n61 %\n63 ",

With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk,\nit is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those\narrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits,\ncommercial paper, money market funds, Accounts receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term\npayables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021. The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2\ninputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).\nNote 21 – Legal Proceedings\nVarious legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.\nIn addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could\nresult or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and\ntreble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or\nsubdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations.\nExcept as described below, we believe,\n108\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbased upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a\nmaterial effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of\nrecorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible\nlosses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be\nmade.\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019\naccident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's\nfinancial statements based on our audits.

The Company uses costs incurred as the method for determining progress, and\nrevenue is recognized based on costs incurred to date plus an estimate of margin at completion. The process of estimating margin at completion\ninvolves estimating the costs to complete production of goods or rendering of services and comparing those costs to the estimated final revenue\namount. Margins on fixed-price development contracts are inherently uncertain in that revenue is fixed while the estimates of costs required to\ncomplete these contracts are subject to significant variability. The operational and technical complexities of fixed-price development contracts\ncreate financial risk, which could increase the estimates of costs and result in lower margins or material reach-forward losses. The ongoing\neffects of macroeconomic challenges, including supply chain disruption, labor shortages, and inflationary pressures compound these\ncomplexities and related financial risks.\nGiven the complexities of certain of the Company’s fixed-price development contracts, including the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, United\nStates Air Force VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, T-7A Redhawk, and MQ-25 contracts, the limited amount of historical data available in certain\ninstances and significant judgments necessary to estimate future costs at completion, auditing these estimates involved extensive audit effort, a\nhigh degree of auditor judgment, and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the cost estimates for the KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, United States Air Force VC-25B Presidential\nAircraft, T-7A Redhawk, and MQ-25 fixed-price development contracts included the following, among others:\n•\nWe evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods used in developing its estimates.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of judgments made and significant assumptions used by management relating to key cost and\nschedule estimates, including the effects of supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, and inflationary pr",

The use of program accounting\nrequires estimating and demonstrating customer demand for the number of units included in the program (program accounting quantity) and\nestimating the sales and costs over the expected life of each program. In particular, estimating the sales and costs associated with the initial\nprogram accounting quantity and the unsold units within the program accounting quantity involve measurement uncertainty resulting in a range\nof reasonable outcomes. Additionally, the level of effort to meet regulatory requirements and achieve certification may be challenging to predict,\nincluding potential delays in the timing of entry into service and corresponding increases in estimated costs.

The Company uses program accounting to compute cost of sales and margin for each commercial airplane sold. The use of program\naccounting requires estimating the revenue expected to be earned upon delivery of the aircraft included in the program’s accounting quantity.\nWhile the 787 program resumed deliveries in 2022, the forecasted delivery schedule and the value of the consideration expected to be provided\nto customers for delivery delays continue to be key factors that affect estimated revenue.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered\nnecessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A\ncompany’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance\nthat transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n120\n\n\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche",

Collected Job Outputs (from junior models):\nChunk ID 0: None\nExplanation: No specific tax rate or explanation was found within this chunk of the document.\nChunk ID 27: 14.8%\nExplanation: I extracted the effective tax rate from the table of consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year 2021.\nCitation: Effective income tax rate 14.8%\nChunk ID 54: U.S. corporate statutory tax rate\nExplanation: This suggests that Boeing uses the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate to calculate their income tax impact. However, it doesn't provide a specific effective tax rate for the fiscal year.\nCitation: The income tax impact is calculated using the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate.\nChunk ID 60: Effective tax rate for 2022 was 0.62%, for 2021 was -14.53%, and for 2020 was 21.15%.\nExplanation: To calculate the effective tax rate, we divide income tax (expense)/benefit by loss before income taxes. Note that negative tax rates indicate a tax benefit.\nCitation: Income tax (expense)/benefit (2022): ($31) / ($5,022) = -0.62%, (2021): $743 / ($4,290) = -17.3%, (2020): $2,535 / ($11,941) = 21.21%\nChunk ID 79: None\nExplanation: No effective tax rate was directly extracted from the given document chunk. However, we can calculate it using Loss before income taxes and Total income tax expense/(benefit).\nChunk ID 80: 17.5%\nExplanation: To find the effective tax rate for Boeing for the fiscal year 2022, we need to look at the income tax expense and total income. However, this specific data point isn't directly available. Instead, we can look at the income tax expense as a percentage of income. In this case, we see that income tax expense was $2,535 and it's noted as 17.5% of something. Given that this number seems to be a percentage of income and it's presented alongside other tax rates (21.0%), it's reasonable to infer that this 17.5% rate refers to Boeing's effective tax rate for 2022.\nCitation: $2,535) 17.5%\nChunk ID 90: None\nExplanation: No specific effective tax rate for Boeing for a fiscal year was found in this document chunk. However, there were mentions of tax benefits and refunds.\nChunk ID 168: None\nExplanation: No specific tax rate or explanation related to tax rates was found within this document chunk.\n\n## Instructions\nThink step-by-step about:\n1. What information we have gathered\n2. Whether it is sufficient to answer the question\n3. If not sufficient, what specific information is missing\n4. If sufficient, how we would calculate or derive the answer\n5. If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have several pieces of information regarding Boeing's effective tax rates for FY2021 and FY2022:\n\n1. **FY2021 Tax Rate:**\n   - Chunk ID 27 mentions a 14.8% effective tax rate for 2021.\n   - Chunk ID 60 provides a detailed calculation showing a -14.53% effective tax rate for 2021, with a citation explaining the calculation as $743 / ($4,290) = -17.3%$. This seems to be a more detailed and reliable source.\n\n2. **FY2022 Tax Rate:**\n   - Chunk ID 60 also provides a detailed calculation for 2022, showing an effective tax rate of 0.62%, with a citation explaining the calculation as ($31) / ($5,022) = -0.62%.\n   - Chunk ID 80 mentions a 17.5% rate for 2022, but the explanation and citation are less clear and seem to be inferred rather than directly stated.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - The information from Chunk ID 60 is the most detailed and includes specific calculations and citations, making it the most reliable source.\n   - The effective tax rate for FY2021 is -14.53%, indicating a tax benefit, while for FY2022, it is 0.62%, indicating a small tax expense.\n   - The conflicting information from Chunk ID 80 (17.5% for 2022) is less reliable due to the lack of clear context and calculation.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - We have sufficient information to answer the question. The effective tax rate for Boeing in FY2022 was 0.62%, compared to -14.53% in FY2021. This indicates a shift from a tax benefit in 2021 to a small tax expense in 2022.\n   - The detailed calculations and citations from Chunk ID 60 provide a clear and reliable basis for this conclusion."
