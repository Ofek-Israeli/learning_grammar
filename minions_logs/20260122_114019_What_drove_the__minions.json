      "output": "To address the question about the increase in Ulta Beauty's merchandise inventories balance at the end of FY2023, focus on identifying key factors mentioned in the financial document. Look for any discussions or notes related to inventory management, purchasing strategies, or supply chain adjustments. Pay attention to any commentary on sales forecasts, changes in consumer demand, or strategic initiatives that might have led to increased inventory levels. Additionally, examine any references to economic conditions, vendor relationships, or promotional activities that could have influenced inventory decisions. Understanding these elements will provide insight into the reasons behind the inventory increase."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

      "output": "From the collected job outputs, we have identified several potential factors contributing to the increase in Ulta Beauty's merchandise inventories at the end of FY2023:\n\n1. **Higher Inventory Shrink**: This was mentioned as a factor affecting gross profit, which could indirectly relate to inventory levels (Chunk ID 1).\n\n2. **Opening of New Stores and Brand Expansions**: The opening of 47 new stores, inventory to support new brand launches, and brand expansions were directly cited as reasons for the increase in inventory (Chunk ID 2).\n\n3. **Inventory Cost Increases**: This was also mentioned alongside the opening of new stores and brand expansions (Chunk ID 2).\n\n4. **Decrease in Sales Forecasts or Consumer Demand**: This was suggested as a possible reason for increased inventory, though it was not directly cited in the document (Chunk ID 5).\n\n5. **Sales by Category Increase**: While not directly linked to inventory levels, an increase in sales by category was noted, which could imply higher inventory to meet demand (Chunk ID 6).\n\nThe information gathered is mostly sufficient to answer the question. The most concrete factors are the opening of new stores, brand expansions, and inventory cost increases, as these are directly cited with specific figures. The mention of higher inventory shrink and potential decreases in sales forecasts or consumer demand are less directly linked and more speculative.\n\nThere are no significant conflicting answers, but the most reliable information comes from Chunk ID 2, which provides specific reasons and figures for the inventory increase.
