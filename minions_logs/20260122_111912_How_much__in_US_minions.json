Compute or extract the answer by primarily using the details outlined in the statement of cash flows.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 623650 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine how much American Water Works paid out in cash dividends for FY2020, focus on the statement of cash flows within the financial document. Specifically, look for the section detailing cash flows from financing activities. This section typically includes information on cash dividends paid. Identify the line item that specifies dividends paid to shareholders, which is usually expressed in millions or billions of USD. Ensure that the figure corresponds to the fiscal year 2020. This will provide the exact amount paid out in cash dividends for that year."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

BUSINESS\nThe Company\nWith a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in\nthe United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Company\nemploys  approximately  7,000  professionals  who  provide  drinking  water,  wastewater  and  other  related  services  to  over  15  million  people  in  46  states.  The\nCompany conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as the “Regulated\nBusinesses.” The Company also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary services. Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria of a\nreportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented as the “Market-\nBased Businesses,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.\nThroughout this Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean American\nWater Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without\nits subsidiaries.\nRegulated Businesses\nThe Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public\nauthority, fire service and sale for resale customers. The Company’s utilities operate in over 1,700 communities in 16 states in the United States, with 3.5 million\nactive customers in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions\nor other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”). Federal, state and local governments also regulate\nenvironmental, health and safety, and water quality and water accountability matters. The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in the\nRegulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,255 million for 2020, $3,094 million for 2019 and $2,984 million for\n2018, accounting for 86%, 86% and 87%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.\nPresented in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses’ operating revenues and the number of customers the Company serves,\nby type of service, for and as of the year ended December 31, 2020:\nOperating Revenues (in millions)\nNumber of Customers (in thousands)\n \nWater (a)\nWastewater\nTot",

A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or\nany other entity that purchases the Company’s water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase the\nCompany’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses. Examples of these customers are homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental\nentities.\nThe vast majority of the Company’s regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage,\ntypically on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters\nwith mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data\nto proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based\nupon their water consumption.\nResidential customers make up a substantial portion of the Company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i)\ncommercial customers, such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers,\nwhere the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire\nsuppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations, (iv)\npublic authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools ",

Specific authority might\ndiffer from state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of\ncapital,  operation  and  maintenance  (“O&M”)  expenses,  capital  expenditures,  taxes,  affiliated  transactions  and  relationships,  reorganizations,  mergers  and\nacquisitions, and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and can change over\ntime. These policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.\nPeriodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is typically\ndetermined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment\ncosts, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” which is the time between\nthe occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and the recognition in rates of that change.\n6\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag.\nPresented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices:\nRegulatory Practices\nDescription\nStates Allowed\nInfrastructure replacement\nsurcharge mechanisms\nAllows rates to change periodically,  outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital  investments\nmade  to  replace  infrastructure  necessary  to  sustain  safe  and  reliable  services  for  the  Company’s  customers.

On February 3, 2021, the Governor issued a press release\nannouncing  that  he  directed  the  NYSDPS  Special  Counsel  to  commence  and  lead  a  municipalization  feasibility  study  to  be  completed  by  April  1,  2021.\nMeanwhile, the Company’s New York subsidiary continues to work constructively with the NYSDPS and is taking the actions necessary to complete the Stock\nPurchase. Subject to satisfying or waiving the various conditions to closing, and assuming no prior termination of the Stock Purchase Agreement by Liberty as\ndescribed above, the Company remains confident that the Stock Purchase will be completed, though the date of the close of the transaction could be impacted by\nthe timing of the work to be completed by the NYSDPS Special Counsel.\nIndustry Legislation\nIn 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey,\nincluding municipal and investor-owned utilities with more than 500 service connections. This law imposes requirements in areas such as cybersecurity, asset\nmanagement, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance.

In an effort to strengthen accountability under the WQAA, the New Jersey Senate held three hearings on the\nWQAA during 2020. The New Jersey Assembly has also heard legislation to strengthen the WQAA in one committee, and referral to the Assembly Appropriations\nCommittee is pending.\nThe Company’s regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia have access to fair\nmarket value legislation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities,\nincluding state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of\npurchased property. Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation,\nwhich allows the Company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assets that is reflective of the assets’ fair market value, while providing the\nCompany with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets, subject to PUC approval.\nIn 2020, legislation in Indiana was passed that created an appraisal process to establish fair value for non-municipal utilities and a presumption that a\npurchase price not exceeding the appraised value is reasonable. That legislation also requires that all new municipal water and wastewater systems are subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the utility regulatory commission for ten years. Separate legislation authorizes recovery for above ground infrastructure, without a full rate case,\nfor service enhancements that are completed for health, safety or environmental concerns. That same legislation also removed relocations completed for road\nconstruction from the distribution system improvement charge recovery caps.\nConsolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected.\nConsolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a state. As\na result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility, support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and\nprioritize capital needs across the state. Overall, the Company believes that consolidated tariffs bring cost-effective, high quality services to a larger number of\ncustomers. Twelve of the Company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa,\nKentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.\n8\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2020, legislation in West Virginia was passed t",

In November 2018, Measure J was certified to have passed. In August 2019, the MPWMD’s\nGeneral  Manager  issued  a  report  that  recommends  that  the  MPWMD  board  (1)  develop  criteria  to  determine  which  water  systems  should  be  considered  for\nacquisition; (2) examine the feasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the MPWMD becomes\nthe owner of a larger system; (3) evaluate whether the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies\nthe criterion of “feasible” as provided in Measure J; (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition; and (5)\ndevelop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.\nIn November 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey\nsystem assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in\nrevenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible.\nOn June 12, 2020, the MPWMD issued a draft environmental impact report for the potential acquisition of the Monterey system assets and a related district\nboundary adjustment that would be required if the MPWMD were to acquire and operate certain of the Monterey system assets located outside the MPWMD’s\nboundaries.

If the MPWMD were\nto make a final determination that an acquisition of the Monterey system assets is feasible, it would then need to file a multi-year eminent domain proceeding\nagainst the Company’s California subsidiary. In that proceeding, it would first need to establish its right to take the Monterey system assets. If such right is\nestablished, the amount of just compensation to be paid to the California subsidiary for such assets would then need to be determined.\nAlso, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit\nagainst the Company’s Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. Before filing its eminent\ndomain lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. The parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports. Although the date\nof the valuation trial is not currently scheduled, it is not likely to commence until the second quarter of 2021.\nFurthermore,  the  law  in  certain  jurisdictions  in  which  the  Regulated  Businesses  operate  provides  for  eminent  domain  rights  allowing  private  property\nowners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage\nto that property.

In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs\nmodels to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity\ndeficits may, to the extent possible, be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of the Company’s\nuse of long-term planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply\nProject”) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the\nconstruction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiary’s purchase of\nwater from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water Pollution\nControl Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate\nunauthorized  diversions  from  the  Carmel  River  as  required  under  orders  of  the  California  State  Water  Resources  Control  Board  (the  “SWRCB”).

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable\nstate laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial\nactions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or\nmore hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such\nsites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup or\ndecontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs to the Company. The\nCompany’s facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder.\nSafe Drinking Water Act\nThe Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels\nof numerous, naturally occurring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose new\nrules.  These  rules  also  prescribe  testing  requirements  for  detecting  regulated  contaminants,  the  treatment  systems  that  may  be  used  for  removing  those\ncontaminants, and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water quality indicators for drinking water, and there is a\nprocess in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.\nTo help formulate the basis for future regulations, the EPA has the authority to require monitoring for additional,  unregulated contaminants  under the\nUnregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (the “Monitoring Rule”). The Company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the Monitoring\nRule  in  previous  rounds,  which  occurs  every  five  years,  including  the  fourth  round  that  conclu",

There  are  millions  of  other  chemical\ncompounds that are not regulated, many of which lack a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects information and/or cost effective treatment options.\nThe process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groups\nby sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See Research and Development—Contaminants of Emerging Concern for additional information.\nTo effect the removal or inactivation of microbial contaminants, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking\nwater and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and/or the by-products of their use in the disinfection process. Examples of these rules are the Long-Term\n2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (the “Long-Term 2 Rule”), the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule, and the Ground Water Rule,\nwhich is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process where\nexceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. The Company is within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with all of\nthese standards, which includes sample collection, data analysis, and, in some instances engineering planning and implementation of treatment enhancements.\nRecent monitoring as required by the Long-Term 2 Rule has indicated that approximately 30 of the Company’s surface water systems have recently completed or\nneed to implement additional disinfection protection mechanisms against Cryptosporidium. In many cases, this will involve installing ultraviolet light disinfection\nsystems, and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades, an estimated $150 million to $250 million of investment will still be\nrequired to upgrade the remaining facilities for Cryptosporidium disinfection. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants,\nincluding  strontium,  hexavalent  chromium,  fluoride,  nitrosamines,  some  pharmaceuticals  and  certain  volatile  organic  compounds.  The  Company  does  not\nanticipate that any such regulations, if enacted, will require implementation in 2021.\n14\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company conducted over ten million water quality and turbidity tests in 2020 at its laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous\nonline instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water.

In  addition,  66  of  the  Company’s  surface  water  treatment  plants  have\nreceived the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 61 plants have received the “Ten-Year Phase III” award, 57 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award,\nand 26 plants have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III” award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20\nyears, respectively. Further, nine of the Company’s surface water plants have received the “Presidents” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the\nPartnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards.\nAlthough it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current cost\nrequirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not\nexpected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental\nmandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operating\nand capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements.\nLead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act\nIn 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions\nin 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water\nAct regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in\nreducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The failure of certain\nwater systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to a\nnumber of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing water\nmain replacement and service line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace lead service lines (“LSLs”) in accordance with current scientific guidance.\nAlso, the Company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory r",

The EPA finalized\nrevisions to the LCR (the “Revised LCR”) on January 15, 2021 that are designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead\nand copper in drinking water. The Company is in the process of reviewing the Revised LCR and will be developing an implementation strategy to comply with the\nnew requirements, which are mandated by January 2024. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisions\ncannot be presently determined until the Company’s review of the new rule is completed, but, as previously noted, costs associated with compliance with federal\nwater quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.\nThe  Company  currently  estimates  that  less  than  5%  of  the  service  lines  within  its  regulated  service  territories  contain  lead  on  either  the  Company  or\ncustomer  portion  of  the  service  line.  The  Company  is  replacing  LSLs  as  part  of  its  ongoing  water  main  replacement  and  service  line  renewal  projects.  The\nCompany’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most of its service areas by the\nend of 2030, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2 billion. The Company believes this will be attainable for most of its service areas where public\npolicy is supportive of this goal. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL\nremoval goals appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal is dependent on several factors, including the Company’s planned water main and\nservice line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers with\nrespect to replacing the customer-owned portion of the LSL as necessary. In certain cases, these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for\nreplacement. Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking Water\nAdvisory Council, the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Company’s preferred approach is to replace\nthe entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line; full LSL replacement is also consistent with the Revised\nLCR.  The  Lead  Service  Line  Replacement  Collaborative  is  a  diverse  group  of  public  health,  water  utility,  environmental,  labor,  consumer  and  housing\norganizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the\nlocal level.\n15\n\n\nTable of Contents\nClean Water Act\nThe Clean Water",

In addition to\nrequirements  applicable  to  the  Company’s  wastewater  collection  systems,  its  operations  require  discharge  permits  under  the  National  Pollutant  Discharge\nElimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit\nprogram, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges\nthat exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant\nfines and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may\nimpose time and cost burdens on the Company’s operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Company’s facilities, some of which result in\nfines. The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company’s Research and Development Program\nThe Company maintains an industry-leading research and development (“R&D”) program that is designed to enhance its services, support its compliance\nactivities, improve service quality and operational effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership.

Technological advances have only recently\nmade it possible to detect many of these contaminants at trace levels. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has invited discussion about these\ncontaminants among regulators and government agencies, which in turn shapes the public’s perception of drinking water quality.\nThe Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 173 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes that\ncan  affect  humans.

Additionally, through\nfrequent labor-management meetings, the Company encourages open exchanges to explore new ways to further enhance safety on the job. All employees are\nempowered to support safety by taking the time they need to complete a task safely and to use “Stop Work Authority” — the power to stop working immediately\nwhenever they believe a task is unsafe — to address the hazard or issue with management. This authority is stated on the back of every employee’s identification\nbadge.\nFor 2020, while the number of injuries for purposes of the Company’s Days Away Restricted or Transferred (“DART“) rate increased by 5% compared to\n2019, the Company had its lowest ORIR injury rate in its recorded history, achieving a 16% reduction compared to 2019. In 2020, the Company also experienced a\n2.6% decrease in labor hours compared to 2019. For 2020, the Company’s ORIR was 0.99 (63 injuries) and its DART rate was 0.63 (40 injuries), compared to a\nDART rate of 0.57 in 2019.\n19\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2020, American Water teams led by promoting safety indicator activities, including pre-job safety briefings and near miss reporting, and by achieving\ninternal Certified Safe Worker designations.

The Company\nutilizes near miss reporting and timely corrective actions as leading indicators of measuring employee engagement and safety performance.\nSupporting Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, American Water has remained committed to the health, well-being, and safety of its employees, as well as their families,\nand its customers and communities. The Company did not lay off any employees due to the pandemic. Also, American Water provided temporary medical and\nemotional health benefits, including paid time off and emergency leave.

Any of the following risks, either alone or taken together, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial position, results of operations,\ncash flows and liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Business Operations\nOur utility operations are subject to extensive regulation by state PUCs and other regulatory agencies, which significantly affects our business, financial\ncondition, results of operations and cash flows. Our utility operations also may be subject to fines, penalties and other sanctions for an inability to meet these\nregulatory requirements.\nOur Regulated Businesses provide water and wastewater services to our customers through subsidiaries that are subject to regulation by state PUCs. This\nregulation affects the rates we charge our customers and has a significant impact on our business and operations. Generally, the state PUCs authorize us to charge\nrates  that  they  determine  are  sufficient  to  recover  our  prudently  incurred  operating  expenses,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  operating  and  maintenance  costs,\ndepreciation, financing costs and taxes, and provide us with the opportunity to earn an appropriate rate of return on invested capital.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and strategy depends on the rates authorized by the various state PUCs. We periodically file rate\nincrease applications with state PUCs. The ensuing administrative process may be lengthy and costly. Our rate increase requests may or may not be approved, or\nmay be partially approved, and any approval may not occur in a timely manner.

Some state PUCs are empowered to impose financial\npenalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Our utilities are also required to have numerous permits, approvals\nand certificates from the PUCs that regulate their businesses and authorize acquisitions, dispositions, debt and/or equity financing, and, in certain cases, affiliated\ntransactions. Although we believe that each utility subsidiary has obtained or sought renewal of the material permits, approvals and certificates necessary for its\nexisting operations, we are unable to predict the impact that future regulatory activities may have on our business.\nThe current COVID-19 pandemic may limit or curtail significantly or entirely the ability of PUCs to approve or authorize applications and other requests we\nmay make with respect to our Regulated Businesses, including without limitation any or all types of approvals described above, as PUCs and their staffs seek to\nreduce, delay or streamline proceedings and other activities. PUCs and other governmental authorities have taken, and may continue to take, emergency or other\nactions in light of the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact us, including prohibiting the termination of service for non-payment during the current COVID-19\npandemic and extending or delaying procedural schedules in our regulatory proceedings.

In addition, billings permitted by state PUCs typically are, to a considerable extent, based on\nthe volume of water usage in addition to a minimum base rate. Thus, we may experience regulatory lag between the time our revenues are affected by declining\nusage and the time we are able to adjust the rate per gallon of usage to address declining usage. Our inability to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag could have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe endeavor to mitigate or reduce regulatory lag by pursuing constructive regulatory practices. For example, three of our states have approved revenue\nstability mechanisms that adjust rates periodically  to ensure that a utility’s  revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs regardless  of sales volume, including\nrecognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. In addition, 11 of our\nstate PUCs permit rates to be adjusted outside of the general rate case application process through surcharges that address certain capital investments, such as\nreplacement of aging infrastructure. These surcharges are adjusted periodically based on factors such as project completion or future budgeted expenditures, and\nspecific surcharges are eliminated once the related capital investment is incorporated in new PUC approved rates.

These\nmechanisms enable us to adjust rates in less time after costs have been incurred than would be the case under a general rate case application process without the\nmechanisms.\nWhile these mechanisms have mitigated or reduced regulatory lag in several of our regulated states, we continue to seek expansion of regulatory practices to\nmitigate or reduce regulatory lag in those jurisdictions that have not approved them. Furthermore, PUCs may fail to adopt new surcharges and existing mechanisms\nmay not continue in their current form, or at all, or we may be unable or become ineligible to continue to utilize certain of these mechanisms in the future.\nAlthough we intend to continue our efforts to expand state PUC approval of surcharges to address issues of regulatory lag, our efforts may not be successful, or\neven if successful they may not completely  address our regulatory  lag, in which case our business, financial  condition, results of operations, cash flows and\nliquidity may be materially and adversely affected.\nChanges in laws and regulations can significantly and materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nNew legislation, regulations, government policies or court decisions, including, without limitation with respect to federal and state income and other tax\nlaws,  can  materially  affect  our  operations,  results  of  operations  and  cash  flows.

In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in\nconnection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires.

See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding\ndebt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In\naddition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our\nliquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to\nbe affected materially and adversely.\nOur inability to access the debt or equity capital or financial markets or other events could affect our ability to meet our liquidity needs at reasonable cost and\nour ability to meet long-term commitments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to cash from op",

The revolving credit facility currently expires in\naccordance with its terms in March 2025, and the 364-day term loan facility will expire in March 2021.

In 2011, the California Public Utilities Commission (the “CPUC”) issued a decision\ndirecting modifications in Cal Am’s tariffs to recognize the moratorium mandated by the 2009 Order, and directing Cal Am to seek written guidance from the\nSWRCB with respect to any unresolved issues of interpretation or implementation of this condition. In 2012, the Deputy Director of the SWRCB sent a letter to\nCal Am providing an interpretation as to the calculation of a baseline to determine increases in use of water at existing service addresses. In March 2018, the\nMPWMD adopted a resolution directing Cal Am to interpret the baseline in a manner that conflicts with the SWRCB’s written interpretation. In May 2018, Cal\nAm notified the MPWMD and the SWRCB that it intends to seek declaratory relief concerning the conflicting regulatory interpretations under the 2009 Order. In\nan attempt to resolve these conflicting interpretations prior to seeking judicial intervention, Cal Am has met with the MPWMD and the SWRCB several times. The\nSWRCB agreed to circulate revisions to its 2012 interpretive letter, which would be subject to a public comment period. Any failure to follow the MPWMD’s\nresolution or the SWRCB’s written interpretation, despite these conflicting interpretations, could potentially result in fines, penalties and other actions against Cal\nAm.\nThe 2016 Order provides that if the CPUC authorizes Cal Am to acquire more than 1,000 acre-feet per year of water from a source other than the Water\nSupply Project,  proponents  of  the  alternative  water  source  could  submit  revised  milestones  to  the  SWRCB for  consideration.  See  Monterey  Peninsula  Water\nSupply Project below. In May 2018, certain parties to the Water Supply Project proceeding submitted a petition to the SWRCB to add parallel milestones to the\n2009 Order for 2019, 2020, and 2021, based on the proposed expansion of the Pure Water Monterey project, another groundwater replenishment project under\nconstruction on the Monterey peninsula. Petitioners claim that compliance with the alternate milestones would still provide for cessation of Cal Am’s unauthorized\ndiversions  from  the  Carmel  River  by  2021.

In December 2019, the\nSWRCB dismissed the petition without prejudice.\nThe 2016 Order imposes yearly milestones related to construction of the Water Supply Project’s desalination plant facilities. If any milestone is missed, the\nSWRCB may impose reductions of up to 1,000 acre-feet per year in the amount of water Cal Am is able to divert from the Carmel River. If a milestone is missed\nfor reasons that are beyond Cal Am’s control, the SWRCB may waive the diversion reduction. On October 21, 2020, Cal Am reported to the SWRCB that, due to\ncircumstances beyond its control, it will be unable to meet the 2020 milestones requiring intake well drilling and plant construction due to (i) delays by the\nCalifornia Coastal Commission (the “Coastal Commission”) in considering Cal Am’s application for a permit for the desalination facility’s intake wells, and (ii) a\nstay  issued  by  the  Monterey  Superior  Court  on  physical  construction  of  the  desalination  plant  in  pending  litigation  over  the  plant’s  construction  permit.\nNevertheless, Cal Am reported that even with a 1,000 acre-foot reduction in Carmel River water supplies, it believed that customer demand could be met without\nadditional rationing in the 2020-2021 water year. On November 17, 2020, the SWRCB provided its view to Cal Am that the milestone reductions were imposed to\nensure  a  staggered  approach  to  ending  unauthorized  diversions,  and  that  regardless  of  fault  a  1,000  acre-foot  reduction  was  an  appropriate  and  intended\nconsequence of missing the milestone.\nCal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for\nthe Water Supply Project.

In May 2019, the City issued a notice of final local action based upon the denial by the Planning Commission of Cal Am’s\ncoastal  development  permit  application.  Thereafter,  Cal  Am  appealed  this  decision  to  the  Coastal  Commission,  as  permitted  under  the  City’s  code  and  the\nCalifornia  Coastal  Act.  At  the  same  time,  Cal  Am  submitted  an  application  to  the  Coastal  Commission  for  a  coastal  development  permit  for  those  project\ncomponents located within the Coastal Commission’s original jurisdiction. In October 2019, staff of the Coastal Commission issued a report recommending a\ndenial of Cal Am’s application for a coastal development permit with respect to the Water Supply Project, largely based on a memorandum prepared by the general\nmanager of the MPWMD that contradicted findings made by the CPUC in its final decision approving the Water Supply Project.

In  November  2014,  the  Coastal  Commission  approved  coastal\ndevelopment permits for the test slant well, enabling Cal Am to construct and operate the test slant well. Because Cal Am may use the test slant well as one of the\nslant wells for the Water Supply Project, Cal Am sought and obtained from the Coastal Commission permit amendments to allow the test slant well to remain in\nplace and be maintained until February 28, 2022. A required lease obtained from the California State Lands Commission, as amended, will expire on December 16,\n2022. Effective February 28, 2018, test slant well pumping ceased, except for minimal maintenance pumping activities, in accordance with Cal Am’s coastal\ndevelopment permits.\nWater Supply Project Land Acquisition and Slant Well Site Use\nIn July 2017, the Coastal Commission adopted a consent agreement and cease and desist order requiring sand mining operations on the property owned by\nCEMEX on which intake wells for the Water Supply Project will be located, to cease by the end of 2020 and the property to be sold to either a non-profit or\ngovernmental entity.

The Company’s business is capital intensive, with a majority of this capital funded by cash flows from operations. When necessary, the\nCompany also obtains funds from external sources, primarily in the debt markets and through short-term commercial paper borrowings. The Company may also\naccess the equity capital markets to support its capital funding requirements, as needed. The Company’s access to external financing on reasonable terms depends\non its credit ratings and current business conditions, including that of the utility and water utility industry in general, as well as conditions in the debt or equity\ncapital markets, and the national and international economic and geopolitical arenas. Disruptions in the credit markets may discourage lenders from extending the\nterms of such commitments or agreeing to new commitments. Market disruptions may also limit the Company’s ability to issue debt and equity securities in the\ncapital markets.\nIf  these  business,  market,  financial  and  other  conditions  deteriorate  to  the  extent  that  the  Company  is  no longer  able  to  access  the  capital  markets  on\nreasonable terms, AWCC has access to an unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2025 with aggregate bank commitments of $2.25 billion. The\nfacility is used principally to fulfill the Company’s short-term liquidity needs by supporting AWCC’s $2.10 billion commercial paper program and to provide a\nsublimit  of  up  to  $150  million  for  letters  of  credit.  Subject  to  satisfying  certain  conditions,  the  credit  agreement  permits  AWCC  to  increase  the  maximum\ncommitment under the facility by up to $500 million.\nIn order to meet short-term liquidity needs, AWCC issues commercial paper that is supported by its revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020,\nAWCC had no outstanding borrowings and $76 million of outstanding letters of credit under its revolving credit facility, with $1.39 billion available to fulfill its\nshort-term liquidity needs and to issue letters of credit. The Company believes that its ability to access the debt and equity capital markets, the revolving credit\nfacility and cash flows from operations will generate sufficient cash to fund the Company’s short-term requirements. The Company believes it has sufficient\nliquidity and the ability to manage its expenditures, should there be a disruption of the capital and credit markets. However, there can no assurance that the lenders\nwill be able to meet existing commitments to AWCC under the revolving credit facility, or that AWCC",

See Credit Facilities and Short-Term Debt below for additional information.\nTo ensure adequate liquidity given the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on debt and capital markets, on March 20, 2020, AWCC entered into a Term\nLoan Credit Agreement, by and among parent company, AWCC and the lenders party thereto, which provided for the Term Loan Facility of up to $750 million.\nOn March 20, 2020, AWCC borrowed $500 million under the Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate purposes of AWCC and\nAmerican Water, and to provide additional liquidity. The Term Loan Facility allowed for a single additional borrowing of up to $250 million, which expired\nunused  on  June  19,  2020.  The  Term  Loan  Facility  commitments  terminate  on  March  19,  2021.  As  of  December  31,  2020,  $500  million  of  principal  was\noutstanding under the Term Loan Facility.\nThe Company uses its capital resources, including cash, primarily to (i) fund operating and capital requirements, (ii) pay interest and meet debt maturities,\n(iii) pay dividends, (iv) fund acquisitions, (v) fund pension and postretirement benefit obligations, and (vi) the Company estimates, during 2021, to begin to pay\nfederal income taxes. The Company invests a significant amount of cash on regulated capital projects where it expects to earn a long-term return on investment.\nAdditionally, the Company operates in rate regulated environments in which the amount of new investment recovery may be limited, and where such recovery\ngenerally takes place over an extended period of time, and certain capital recovery is also subject to regulatory lag. See Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses\n—Regulation and Rate Making for additional information. The Company expects to fund future maturities of long-term debt through a combination of external\ndebt and, to the extent available, cash flows from operations. Since the Company expects its capital investments over the next few years to be greater than its cash\nflows from operating activities, the Company currently plans to fund the excess of its capital investments over its cash flows from operating activities for the next\nfive years through a combination of long-term debt and equity. If necessary, the Company may delay certain capital investments or other funding requirements, or\npursue financing from other sources to preserve liquidity. In this event, the Company believes it can rely upon cash flows from operations to meet its obligations\nand fund its minimum required capital investments for an extended period of time.\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities primarily result from the sale of water and wastewater services and, due to the seasonality of demand, are\ngenerally  greater  during the warmer  months.

The main factors contributing to the\nincrease in net income are described in “Consolidated Results of Operations” and “Segment Results of Operations” above. Partially offsetting these increases was a\nchange in working capital, primarily resulting from the following: (i) an increase in accounts receivable, net due to increased revenues compared to the same period\nin the prior year and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020; (ii) an increase in unbilled revenues as a result of MSG achieving significant capital project\nmilestones during 2020; (iii) a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to the timing of both capital projects and invoices; and (iv) a partial offset\ndue to the change in other current assets.\nThe Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $37 million in 2021.

These activities included the issuance of long-term and short-term debt, primarily through AWCC and in 2018, an equity issuance to fund\napproximately 50% of the purchase price of the Pivotal acquisition. Based on the needs of the Regulated Businesses and the Company, AWCC may borrow funds\nor issue its debt in the capital markets and then, through intercompany loans, provide those borrowings to the Regulated Businesses and parent company. The\nRegulated Businesses and parent company are obligated to pay their portion of the respective principal and interest to AWCC, in the amount necessary to enable\nAWCC to meet its debt service obligations.

Security ratings are highly dependent upon the ability to generate cash flows in an\namount sufficient to service debt and meet investment plans. The Company can provide no assurances that its ability to generate cash flows is sufficient to maintain\nits existing ratings. None of the Company’s borrowings are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings, although such\na downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility.\nAs part of its normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into contracts for the purchase and sale of water, energy, chemicals and other\nservices.  These  contracts  either  contain  express  provisions  or  otherwise  permit  the  Company  and  its  counterparties  to  demand  adequate  assurance  of  future\nperformance when there are reasonable grounds for doing so. In accordance with the contracts and applicable contract law, if the Company is downgraded by a\ncredit rating agency, especially if such downgrade is to a level below investment grade, it is possible that a counterparty would attempt to rely on such a downgrade\nas a basis for making a demand for adequate assurance of future performance, which could include a demand that the Company must provide collateral to secure its\nobligations. The Company does not expect to post any collateral which will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial\nposition or cash flows.\nAccess to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the\nCompany’s securities ratings.

Such losses could have a material adverse effect on the\nCompany’s short-term and long-term financial condition and its results of operations and cash flows.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates, assumptions and\njudgments that could affect the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates, assumptions\nand judgments. Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates\nand assumptions in matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.

Such judgments include, but\nare not limited to, assets and liabilities related to regulated acquisitions, pension and postretirement benefits, depreciation rates and taxes. Due to timing and other\ndifferences in the collection of revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated\nentity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, the principles require the creation of a\nregulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are\nrefundable to customers.\nFor each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business, the Company assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory\nassets  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  recovery  and  regulatory  liabilities  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  This\nassessment includes consideration of factors such as changes in regulatory environments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific\nor similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction) and the status of any pending or potential legislation. If subsequent events indicate that\nthe regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Company’s Consolidated Statements of\nOperations and financial position could be materially affected.

If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit of the tax position will be sustained on its technical\nmerits,  no benefit  is recorded.  Uncertain tax positions that relate  only to timing of when an item  is included  on a tax return are considered to have met the\nrecognition threshold. Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position\nwill be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition\nthreshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of unrecognized tax benefit to be recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and its intent and ability to\nimplement tax planning strategies, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the\nform of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements. The Company records valuation allowances for deferred tax\nassets when it concludes that it is more-likely-than-not such benefit will not be realized in future periods.\n71\n\n\nTable of Contents\nUnder  GAAP, specifically  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  740, Income  Taxes (“ASC  740”),  the  tax  effects  of  changes  in  tax  laws  must  be\nrecognized in the period in which the law is enacted. ASC 740 also requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to\napply when temporary differences are to be realized or settled. Thus, at the date of enactment of the TCJA, the Company’s deferred taxes were re-measured based\nupon the new tax rate. For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or liability and may\nbe subject to refund to customers. For the Company’s unregulated operations, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as a non-cash re-measurement adjustment\nto earnings.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts due to the future impacts of various items, including changes in income tax laws, the Company’s\nforecasted financial condition and results of operations, failure to successfully implement tax planning strategies and recovery of taxes through the regulatory\nprocess for the Regulated Businesses, as well as results of audits and examinations of filed tax returns by taxing authorities.

Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions provided\nby the Company to its actuaries, including the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Material changes in the Company’s pension and\npostretirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions as well as fluctuations in plan assets. The assumptions are selected to\nrepresent the average expected experience over time and may differ in any one year from actual experience due to changes in capital markets and the overall\neconomy. These differences will impact the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit expense that the Company recognizes. The primary assumptions\nare:\n•\nDiscount Rate—The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made\nin the future. The objective in selecting the discount rate is to measure the single amount that, if invested at the measurement date in a portfolio of\nhigh-quality debt instruments, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the accumulated benefits when due.\n•\nExpected Return on Plan Assets (“EROA”)—Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily\nbased upon the plans’ mix of assets and expectations for the long-term returns on those asset classes. These projected returns reduce the net benefit\ncosts the Company records currently.\n•\nRate  of  Compensation  Increase—Management  projects  employees’  pay  increases,  which  are  used  to  project  employees’  pension  benefits  at\nretirement.\n•\nHealth Care Cost Trend Rate—Management projects the expected increases in the cost of health care.\n•\nMortality— Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 mortality base table, the most recent table developed from private pension plan\nexperience, which provides rates of mortality in 2012 and adopted the new MP-2020 mortality improvement scale to gradually adjust future mortality\nrat",

The  Company  uses  an  approach  that  approximates  the  process  of  settlement  of\nobligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows by matching the plans’ cash flows to the coupons and expected maturity values of individually selected\nbonds. For each plan, the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would yield the same present value as using spot rates aligned with the\nprojected benefit payments.

These contracts\ncontain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately\nidentifiable  from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.

Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis, and unbilled amounts\ncalculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts\nthat the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value\ntransferred to the customer.\nIncreases or decreases in the volumes delivered to customers and rate mix due to changes in usage patterns in customer classes in the period could be\nsignificant to the calculation of unbilled revenue. In addition, changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for\neach meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation. Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31,\n2020 and 2019 was $150 million and $142 million, respectively.\nThe Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to be credited to\ncustomers will occur through the ratemaking process.\nRevenue from the Company’s Homeowner Services Group is generated through various protection programs in which the Company provides fixed fee\nservices to domestic homeowners and smaller commercial customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and\ncooling",

The Company manages its interest rate exposure by\nlimiting its variable rate exposure and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. The Company also has the ability to enter into financial\nderivative instruments, which could include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock\nagreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure.

A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in\naccordance with authorizations of management and direct",

Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe  critical  audit  matter  communicated  below  is  a  matter  arising  from  the  current  period  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  that  was\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial\nstatements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way\nour opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate\nopinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAccounting for the Effects of Rate Regulation\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated regulatory assets and liabilities balances were $1,127\nmillion  and $1,770  million,  respectively,  as  of  December  31,  2020.  The  Company’s  regulated  utilities  are  subject  to  regulation  by  multiple  state  utility\ncommissions and the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the effects of rate regulation to be\nreflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As disclosed by management, for each regulatory jurisdiction where the Company conducts business,\nmanagement assesses, at the end of each reporting period, whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery and regulatory\nliabilities  continue  to  meet  the  criteria  for  probable  future  settlement.  This  assessment  includes  consideration  of  factors  such  as  changes  in  regulatory\nenvironments, recent rate orders (including recent rate orders on recovery of a specific or similar incurred cost to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction)\nand the status of any pending or potential legislation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit\nmatter are the significant judgment by management in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to whether regulatory assets continue to meet the\ncriteria for prob",

(the  “Company”  or  “American  Water”)  is  a  holding  company  for  regulated  and  market-based  subsidiaries\nthroughout the United States. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries. The Company’s primary\nbusiness involves the ownership of regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services in 16 states in the United States, collectively referred to as the\n“Regulated  Businesses.”  The  Company  also  operates  market-based  businesses  that  provide  water  and  wastewater  services  within  non-reportable  operating\nsegments, collectively referred to as the “Market-Based Businesses.” The Company’s primary Market-Based Businesses include the Homeowner Services Group\n(“HOS”), which provides various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers; and the Military Services Group (“MSG”), which\nenters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations.\nNote 2: Significant Accounting Policies\nRegulation\nThe Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively\nreferred to as Public Utility Commissions (“PUCs”). As such, the Company follows authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which\nrequires the effects of rate regulation to be reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. PUCs generally authorize revenue at levels intended to\nrecover the estimated costs of providing service, plus a return on net investments, or rate base. Regulators may also approve accounting treatments, long-term\nfinancing  programs  and  cost  of  capital,  operation  and  maintenance  (“O&M”)  expenses,  capital  expenditures,  taxes,  affiliated  transactions  and  relationships,\nreorganizations, mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Due to timing and other differences in\nthe collection of a regulated utility’s revenues, these authoritative accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-\nregulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates. Conversely, these principles also require the\ncreation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future, or amounts collected in excess of costs\nincurred and are refundable to customers.

Actual results\ncould differ from these estimates, assumptions and judgments. The Company considers its critical accounting estimates to include (i) the application of regulatory\naccounting  principles  and  the  related  determination  and  estimation  of  regulatory  assets  and  liabilities,  (ii)  revenue  recognition  and  the  estimates  used  in  the\ncalculation of unbilled revenue, (iii) accounting for income taxes, (iv) benefit plan assumptions and (v) the estimates and judgments used in determining loss\ncontingencies. The Company’s critical accounting estimates that are particularly sensitive to change in the near term are amounts reported for regulatory assets and\nliabilities, income taxes, benefit plan assumptions and contingency-related obligations.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of American Water and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is\nmaintained after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consists primarily of utility plant utilized by the Company’s regulated utilities. Additions to utility plant and replacement of\nretirement units of utility plant are capitalized and include costs such as materials, direct labor, payroll taxes and benefits, indirect items such as engineering and\nsupervision, transportation and an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). Costs for repair, maintenance and minor replacements are charged to\nO&M expense as incurred.\nThe cost of utility plant is depreciated using the straight-line average remaining life, group method. The Company’s regulated utilities record depreciation in\nconformity with amounts approved by PUCs, after regulatory review of the information the Company submits to support its estimates of the assets’ remaining\nuseful lives.\n86\n\n\nTable of Contents\nNonutility property consists primarily of buildings and equipment utilized by the Company’s Market-Based Businesses and for internal operations. This\nproperty is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation, which is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the assets.\nWhen units of property, plant and equipment are replaced, retired or abandoned, the carrying value is credited against the asset and charged to accumulated\ndepreciation. To the extent the Company recovers cost of removal or other retirement costs through rates after the retirement costs are incurred, a regulatory asset\nis recorded. In some cases, the Company recovers retirement costs through rates during the life of the associated asset and be",

The Company implemented the guidance in the Standard using the modified retrospective approach and applied the optional transition method, which\nallowed entities to apply the new Standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the\nperiod of adoption. Under this approach, prior periods have not been restated and continue to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe Standard includes practical expedients, which relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the adoption date, initial direct\ncosts for leases that commenced before the adoption date, the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the\nunderlying asset and the ability to carry forward accounting treatment for existing land easements.\nAdoption of the Standard resulted in the recognition of operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and operating lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019 of\napproximately $117 million and $115 million, respectively. The difference between the ROU assets and operating lease liabilities was recorded as an adjustment to\nretained earnings. The Standard did not materially impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations and had no impact on cash flows.\nThe Company has operating and finance leases involving real property, including facilities, utility assets, vehicles, and equipment. The Company determines\nif an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, accrued liabilities and operating lease liabilities on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in property, plant and equipment, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated\nBalance Sheets. The Company has made an accounting policy election not to include operating leases with a lease term of twelve months or less.\nROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and the lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising\nfrom the lease.

As most of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information\navailable at the commencement date in determining the present value of discounted lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. ROU\nassets also include any upfront lease payments and excludes lease incentives. The Company’s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease\nwhen it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe  Company  has  lease  agreements  with  lease  components  (e.g.,  fixed  payments  including  rent,  real  estate  taxes  and  insurance  costs)  and  non-lease\ncomponents (e.g., common-area maintenance costs), which are generally accounted for separately; however, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease\ncomponents  as  a  single  lease  component  for  certain  leases.  Certain  lease  agreements  include  variable  rental  payments  adjusted  periodically  for  inflation.\nAdditionally, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company’s lease agreements do not\ncontain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of a\nbusiness. Goodwill is not amortized and must be allocated at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below, and tested for\nimpairment at least annually, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting\nunit below its carrying value.\nThe Company’s goodwill is primarily associated with (i) the acquisition of American Water by an affiliate of the Company’s previous owner in 2003, (ii)\nthe acquisition of E’town Corporation by a predecessor to the Company’s previous owner in 2001, and (iii) the acquisition of Pivotal in 2018; and has been\nallocated to reporting units based on the fair values at the date of the acquisitions. For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the reporting units in the\nRegulated Businesses segment are aggregated into a single reporting unit. The Market-Based Businesses is comprised of the HOS and MSG reporting units.\nThe Company’s annual impairment testing is performed as of November 30 of each year, in conjunction with the completion of the Company’s annual\nbusiness plan. The Company assesses qualitative factors to determine whether quantitative testing is necessary.

If the Company bypasses the\nqualitative assessment, or performs the qualitative assessment and determines that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not, less than its\ncarrying value, a quantitative, fair value-based test is performed. This quantitative testing compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its respective\nnet carrying value, including goodwill, on the measurement date. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s\ncarrying value compared to its estimated fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\nApplication of goodwill impairment testing requires management judgment, including the identification of reporting units and determining the fair value of\nreporting units. Management estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis. Significant assumptions used in these fair value estimations include, but\nare not limited to, forecasts of future operating results, discount and growth rates.\nThe Company believes the assumptions and other considerations used to value goodwill to be appropriate, however, if actual experience differs from the\nassumptions and considerations used in its analysis, the resulting change could have a material adverse impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note\n9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist primarily of finite-lived customer relationships associated with the acquisition of Pivotal. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially\nmeasured at their estimated fair values, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible\nassets are consumed or otherwise used. See Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill, intangible assets and long-term investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assets\nfor impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. When such indicators arise, the Company estimates the fair\nvalue of the long-lived asset from future cash flows expected to result from its use and, if applicable, the eventual disposition of the asset, comparing the estimated\nfair value to the carrying value of the asset. An impairment loss will be recognized in the amount equal to the excess of the long-lived asset’s carrying value\ncompared to its estimated fair value.\nThe long-lived assets of the Company’s regulated utilities are grouped on a separate entity basis for impairment testing, as they are integrated state-wide\noperations that do not have the option to curtail service and generally have uniform tariffs.

Included in\nother current liabilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are estimated refunds of $23 million and $25 million, respectively.\nThose amounts represent expected refunds during the next 12-month period.\nAdvances that are no longer refundable are reclassified to contributions. Contributions are permanent collections of plant assets or cash for a particular\nconstruction project. For ratemaking purposes, the amount of such contributions generally serves as a rate base reduction since the contributions represent non-\ninvestor supplied funds.\nGenerally, the Company depreciates utility plant funded by contributions and amortizes its contributions balance as a reduction to depreciation expense,\nproducing a result which is functionally equivalent to reducing the original cost of the utility plant for the contributions. In accordance with applicable regulatory\nguidelines, some of the Company’s utility subsidiaries do not amortize contributions, and any contribution received remains on the balance sheet indefinitely.\nAmortization  of  contributions  in  aid  of  construction  was  $32  million,  $29  million  and  $28  million  for  the  years  ended  December  31,  2020,  2019  and  2018,\nrespectively.\nRevenue Recognition\nOn  January  1,  2018,  the  Company  adopted  Accounting  Standards  Codification  Topic  606, Revenue  From  Contracts  With  Customers, and all  related\namendments (collectively, “ASC 606”), using the modified retrospective approach, applied to contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018.\n89\n\n\nTable of Contents\nUnder ASC 606, a performance obligation is a promise within a contract to transfer a distinct good or service, or a series of distinct goods and services, to a\ncustomer.

These contracts\ncontain a single performance obligation, the delivery of water and/or wastewater services, as the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately\nidentifiable  from  other  promises  within  the  contracts  and,  therefore,  is  not  distinct.  Revenues  are  recognized  over  time,  as  services  are  provided.  There  are\ngenerally no significant financing components or variable consideration. Revenues include amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts\ncalculated based on estimated usage from the date of the meter reading associated with the latest customer bill, to the end of the accounting period. The amounts\nthat the Company has a right to invoice are determined by each customer’s actual usage, an indicator that the invoice amount corresponds directly to the value\ntransferred to the customer. The Company also recognizes revenue when it is probable that future recovery of previously incurred costs or future refunds that are to\nbe credited to customers will occur through the ratemaking process.\nMarket-Based Businesses Revenue\nThrough various warranty protection programs and other home services, the Company provides fixed fee services to residential customers for interior and\nexterior water and sewer lines, interior electric and gas lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and other home appliances, as well as power surge\nprotection and other related services.

Billing and revenue recognition for the fixed fee revenues occurs ratably over the term of the contract, as\ncustomers  simultaneously  receive  and  consume  the  benefits  provided  by  the  Company.  Additionally,  these  contracts  allow  the  Company  to  make  capital\nimprovements to underlying infrastructure, which are initiated through separate modifications or amendments to the original contract, whereby stand-alone, fixed\npricing  is  separately  stated  for  each  improvement.

The  Company  has  also  experienced\ndecreased revenues as a result of the suspension of late fees and foregone reconnect fees. These impacts are collectively referred to as “financial impacts.”\nAs of February 24, 2021, American Water has commission orders authorizing deferred accounting for COVID-19 financial impacts in 11 of 14 jurisdictions,\nwith proceedings in two jurisdictions pending. In addition to approving deferred accounting, to date, two regulatory jurisdictions have also approved cost recovery\nmechanisms for specified COVID-19 financial impacts.

At the closing of the offering, AWCC received, after deduction of\nunderwriting discounts and before deduction of offering expenses, net proceeds of $989 million. AWCC used the net proceeds of this offering: to (i) lend funds to\nparent company and its regulated subsidiaries; (ii) to fund sinking fund payments for, and to repay at maturity, $28 million in aggregate principal amount of\noutstanding long-term debt of AWCC and certain of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries; (iii) to repay AWCC’s commercial paper obligations and short-term\nindebtedness under AWCC’s $2.25 billion unsecured revolving credit facility; and (iv) for general corporate purposes.\nOne of the principal market risks to which the Company is exposed is changes in interest rates. In order to manage the exposure, the Company follows risk\nmanagement  policies  and  procedures,  including  the  use  of  derivative  contracts  such  as  swaps. The  Company  reduces  exposure  to  interest  rates  by managing\ncommercial paper and debt maturities. The Company also does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments.\nThe derivative contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures. The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to\nderivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations and minimizes this risk by dealing only with leading, credit-worthy financial institutions having\nlong-term credit ratings of “A” or better.\nDuring March 2020, the Company entered into four 10-year treasury lock agreements, each with a notional amount of $100 million, to reduce interest rate\nexposure on debt, which was subsequently issued on April 14, 2020. These treasury lock agreements had an average fixed rate of 0.94%. The Company designated\nthese treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges, with their fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive gain or loss. On April 8, 2020 the Company\nterminated these four treasury lock agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $400 million, realizing a net loss of $6 million, to be amortized through\ninterest, net over a 10 year period, in accordance with the terms of the $1.0 billion new debt issu",

On March 20, 2020, AWCC borrowed $500 million under the Term Loan Facility, the proceeds of which were used for general corporate\npurposes of AWCC and parent company, and to provide additional liquidity. The Term Loan Facility allowed for a single additional borrowing of up to $250\nmillion, which expired unused on June 19, 2020. The Term Loan Facility commitments terminate on March 19, 2021. AWCC may prepay all or a portion of\namounts due under the Term Loan Facility without any premium or penalty. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a variable annual rate based\non LIBOR, plus a margin of 0.80%. The credit agreement for the Term Loan Facility contains the same affirmative and negative covenants and events of default as\nunder AWCC’s $2.25 billion revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2020, $500 million of principal was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility.\nShort-term debt consists of commercial paper and credit facility borrowings totaling $786 million for both periods ending December 31, 2020 and 2019. The\nweighted  average  interest  rate  on  AWCC  short-term  borrowings  was  approximately  1.16%  and  2.54%  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2020  and  2019,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2020 there were no borrowings outstanding with maturities greater than three months.\nLiquidity needs for capital investment, working capital and other financial commitments are funded through cash flows from operations, public and private\ndebt offerings, commercial paper markets and, if and to the extent necessary, borrowings under the AWCC revolving credit facility and, in the future, issuances of\nequity. The revolving credit facility provides $2.25 billion in aggregate total commitments from a diversified group of financial institutions. On April 1, 2020, the\ntermination date of the credit agreement with respect to AWCC’s revolving credit facility was extended, pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement, from March\n21, 2024 to March 21, 2025. The facility is used principally to support AWCC’s commercial paper program and to provide a sub-limit of up to $150 million for\nletters of credit. Letters of credit are non-debt instruments maintained to provide credit support for certain transactions as requested by third parties. Subject to\nsatisfying certain conditions, the credit agreement also permits AWCC to increase the maximum commitment under the facility by up to an aggregate of $500\nmillion. As of December",

Further, the Company will consider additional cash contributions and/or available prefunding balances if needed to avoid “at risk”\nstatus and benefit restrictions under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”).

In setting new strategic asset mixes, consideration is given to the likelihood that the\nselected asset allocation will effectively fund the projected plan liabilities and meet the risk tolerance criteria of the Company. The Company periodically updates\nthe  long-term,  strategic  asset  allocations  for  these  plans  through  asset  liability  studies  and  uses  various  analytics  to  determine  the  optimal  asset  allocation.\nConsiderations include plan liability characteristics, liquidity needs, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns.\nIn 2018, the Company announced plan design changes to the medical bargaining benefit plan, which resulted in a cap on future benefits and an over funded\npostretirement medical benefits bargaining plan. As a result of the change in funded status, the Company decreased the investment risk in the plan and reduced its\nexposure to changes in interest rates by matching the assets of the plan to the projected cash flows for future benefit payments of the liability.\n114\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company engages third-party investment managers for all invested assets. Managers are not permitted to invest outside of the asset class (e.g. fixed\nincome,  equity,  alternatives)  or  strategy  for  which  they  have  been  appointed.  Investment  management  agreements  and  recurring  performance  and  attribution\nanalysis are used as tools to ensure investment managers invest solely within the investment strategy they have been provided. Futures and options may be used to\nadjust portfolio duration to align with a plan’s targeted investment policy.\nIn order to minimize asset volatility relative to the liabilities, a portion of plan assets is allocated to long duration fixed income investments that are exposed\nto interest rate risk. Increases in interest rates generally will result in a decline in the value of fixed income assets while reducing the present value of the liabilities.\nConversely,  rate  decreases  will  increase  fixed  income  assets,  partially  offsetting  the  related  increase  in  the  liabilities.  Within  equities,  risk  is  mitigated  by\nconstructing a portfolio that is broadly diversified by geography, market capitalization, manager mandate size, investment style and process. For the postretirement\nmedical bargaining plan, its asset structure is designed to meet the cash flows of the liabilities. This design reduces the plan’s exposure to changes in interest rates.\nActual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy updates, market value fluctuations, the length of time it\ntakes to fully implement investment allocations, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. The asset allocation is rebalanced on a quarterly basis, if\nnecessary. Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”) ",

The  Company’s  qualified  defined  benefit  plan  is  currently  funded  above  the  at-risk  threshold,  and  therefore  the\nCompany expects that the plans will not be subject to the “at risk” funding requirements of the PPA. The Company is proactively monitoring the plan’s funded\nstatus and projected contributions under the law to appropriately manage the potential impact on cash requirements.\nMinimum  funding  requirements  for  the  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plan  are  determined  by  government  regulations  and  not  by  accounting\npronouncements. The Company plans to contribute amounts at least equal to or greater than the minimum required contributions or the normal cost in 2021 to the\nqualified pension plans. Contributions may be in the form of cash contributions as well as available prefunding balances.\nPresented in the table below is information about the expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement benefit plans:\nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n2021 expected employer contributions:\n \n \nTo plan trusts\n$\n37 \n$\n— \nTo plan participants\n2 \n— \n118\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPresented in the table below are the net benefits expected to be paid from the plan assets or the Company’s assets:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n \nExpected Benefit\nPayments\nExpected Benefit\nPayments\nExpected Federal Subsidy\nPayments\n2021\n$\n127 \n$\n27 \n$\n1 \n2022\n128 \n27 \n1 \n2023\n133 \n27 \n1 \n2024\n135 \n27 \n1 \n2025\n137 \n26 \n1 \n2026-2030\n692 \n123 \n4 \nBecause the above amounts are net benefits, plan participants’ contributions have been excluded from the expected benefits.\nAccounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets,\nthe rate of future compensation increases received by the Company’s employees, mortality, turnover and medical costs.

The CPUC’s 2018 decision concludes that the Water Supply Project is the best project to address estimated future water\ndemands in Monterey, and, in addition to the cost recovery approved in its 2016 decision, adopts Cal Am’s cost estimates for the Water Supply Project, which\namounted to an aggregate of $279 million plus AFUDC at a rate representative of Cal Am’s actual financing costs.

Although the report concluded that the Water Supply Project would have a negligible impact on groundwater resources, the report also concluded it would\nimpact  other  coastal  resources,  such  as  environmentally  sensitive  habitat  areas  and  wetlands,  and  that  the  Coastal  Commission  staff  believes  that  a  feasible\nalternative project exists that would avoid those impacts. The staff’s report also noted disproportionate impacts to communities of concern. On September 16,\n2020, Cal Am withdrew its original jurisdiction application to allow additional time to address the Coastal Commission staff’s environmental justice concerns. The\nwithdrawal of the original jurisdiction application did not impact Cal Am’s appeal of the City’s denial, which remains pending before the Coastal Commission. Cal\nAm refiled the original jurisdiction application on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the Coastal Commission sent to Cal Am a notice of incomplete\napplication, identifying certain additional information needed to consider the application complete. Cal Am is preparing a response to the Coastal Commission’s\nnotice.\nCal Am continues to work constructively with all appropriate agencies to provide necessary information in connection with obtaining required approvals for\nthe Water Supply Project.

These and other\nprovisions may have the effect of deferring, delaying or discouraging hostile takeovers, or changes in control or management of the Company.\nRequirements for Advance Notification of Shareholder Meetings, Nominations and Proposals\nThe Bylaws provide that special meetings of shareholders may be called only upon the request of the majority of the members of the Board, upon request of\nthe Chairman of the Board, or by the Secretary of the Company upon request of shareholders holding at least 15% of the outstanding Common Stock. The Bylaws\nprohibit the conduct of any business at a special meeting other than as specified in the notice for such meeting.\nThe Bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to shareholder proposals for annual meetings and the nomination of candidates for election as\ndirectors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof. A shareholder who wishes to bring a matter before a meeting\nmust comply with the Company’s advance notice requirements and provide the Company with certain information. Additionally, vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships may be filled only by a vote of a majority of the members of the Board then in office, even though less than a quorum, or by shareholders. These\nprovisions may defer, delay or discourage a potential acquiror from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquiror’s own slate of directors or otherwise\nattempting to obtain control of the Company.\nShareholder Action by Written Consent\nAs permitted by Section 228 of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation states that any action required or permitted to be taken by the Company’s\nshareholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and may not be effected by consent in writing by such shareholders.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Matters\nA significant number of the Company’s regulated subsidiaries are subject to economic regulation by state public utility commissions. Some of these states\nhave enacted laws that require regulatory approval for the acquisition of “control” of any regulated utility. In those states, obtaining “control” of the parent or any\nother company that controls a regulated utility also requires prior regulatory approval. The threshold for a change in control is a fact-specific inquiry that varies by\nstate. For example, in some states, a presumption of control will arise when an acquiring party acquires more than 9.9% of the voting securities of the regulated\nutility or the controlling entity. In addition to ownership, other states may analyze the degree of influence or control an acquiror may exert over the company. Any\nperson acquiring Common Stock in an offering or in any other purchase of Common Stock in an amount sufficient to trigger a change in control under state law\nwould need the prior approval of the applicable state public utility commission.\nCertain Other Provisions of the Certificate of Incorp",

These\nrestrictions generally prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change-in-control attempts that are not approved by a company’s board\nof directors.\nLimitations of Liability and Indemnification of Directors and Officers\nThe DGCL authorizes corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their shareholders for monetary damages for\nbreaches of directors’ fiduciary duties. The Certificate of Incorporation includes a provision that eliminates the personal liability of directors for monetary damages\nfor actions taken as a director to the fullest extent authorized by the DGCL.

These chunks provide a clear and repeated figure, with citations indicating that this amount was paid in 2020, 2019, and 2018.\n3. **Chunk ID 105** mentions higher dividends paid in 2020 but does not specify an amount.\n4.
