      "output": "To determine the FY2015 operating cash flow ratio for Adobe, focus on extracting two key pieces of information from the financial document: the cash from operations and the total current liabilities for the fiscal year 2015. The cash from operations can be found in the cash flow statement, typically under the section titled \"Cash Flows from Operating Activities.\" This figure represents the net cash generated from Adobe's core business operations during the year. The total current liabilities are located in the statement of financial position, often referred to as the balance sheet. This figure includes all liabilities that are due within one year, such as accounts payable, short-term debt, and other similar obligations. Once you have these two figures, calculate the operating cash flow ratio by dividing the cash from operations by the total current liabilities, and round the result to two decimal places. This ratio provides insight into Adobe's ability to cover its short-term liabilities with the cash generated from its operations."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time.

Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF \nOPERATIONS \nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto.\nACQUISITIONS \nDuring fiscal 2015, we completed our acquisition of privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for royalty-free photos, \nimages, graphics and HD videos, for $807.5 million. During fiscal 2015, we integrated Fotolia into our Digital Media reportable \nsegment. \nDuring fiscal 2013, we completed our acquisitions of privately held Neolane, a leader in cross-channel campaign \nmanagement technology for  $616.7 million, and privately held Behance, an online social media platform to showcase and discover \ncreative work for $111.1 million. During fiscal 2013, we integrated Neolane and Behance into our Digital Marketing and Digital \nMedia reportable segments, respectively. \nWe also completed other immaterial business acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. Pro forma information has not \nbeen presented for any of our fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 acquisitions as the impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements was \nnot material.\nSee Note 2 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding these acquisitions. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP and pursuant to the rules and regulations of \nthe SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, \nand related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical \nexperience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially \nfrom these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and \nestimates. We also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe believe that the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition, business \ncombinations, goodwill impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. \nThese areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules requiring us to make judgments and \nestimates, so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies. Historically, our assumptions, judgments and estimates \nrelative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from the licensing of subscription, perpetual and time-based software products, associated software \nmaintenance and support plans, non-software related hosted services",

The cost \nbuild-up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin. \nThe estimated costs to fulfill the obligations are based on the historical costs related to fulfilling the obligations.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair value of the equity awards \nassumed. The estimated fair value is determined utilizing a modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employees \nexercise their stock options when the share price exceeds the strike price by a certain dollar threshold. If the acquired company \nhas significant historical data on their employee’s exercise behavior, then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired \ncompany’s history. Otherwise, our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold. Zero coupon yields \nimplied by U.S. Treasury issuances, implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other inputs to \nthe binomial model.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates \nor actual results.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis, during the second quarter of our fiscal year, or more frequently, \nif changes in facts and circumstances indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may \nexist. In order to estimate the fair value of goodwill, we typically estimate future revenue, consider market factors and estimate \nour future cash flows. Based on these key assumptions, judgments and estimates, we determine whether we need to record an \nimpairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value. Assumptions, judgments \nand estimates about future values are complex and often subjective. They can be affected by a variety of factors, including external \nfactors such as industry and economic trends, and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts. \nAlthough we believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, \ndifferent assumptions, judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results.\nWe completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and determined there was no impairment. \nThe results of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair values of our reporting units are significantly in excess of their \ncarrying values.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized \nfor the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year.

Unanticipated changes in our tax rates \ncould affect our future results of operations. Our future effective tax rates could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax \nrates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation of, tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions \nin which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amount of earnings in countries with low statutory tax rates, or by \nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, countries in the European Union and other \ncountries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and \ninterpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals such as Adobe. These potential changes could \nadversely affect our effective tax rates or result in other costs to us.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements \nOn November 20, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet \nClassification of Deferred Taxes, requiring all deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any related valuation allowance, to be classified \nas non-current on the balance sheet. The classification change for all deferred taxes as non-current simplifies entities’ processes \nas it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non-current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction \nand allocate valuation allowances. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter \nof fiscal 2015. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to \nrecognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. \nThe updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and \npermits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. \n2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new \nrevenue standard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not \nearlier than the original effective date. Accordingly, the updated standard is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We \nhave not yet selected a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect",

Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for \nmulti-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior \nto renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed.

This is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received \nor posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, \nwe enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit related losses with the same counterparty \nby permitting net settlement transactions. \nThe aggregate fair value of foreign currency contracts in net asset positions as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, \n2014 was $19.1 million and $33.0 million respectively. These amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting \ndate as a result of all of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. These exposures could be reduced by certain immaterial \nliabilities included in master netting arrangements with those same counterparties. \nCredit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, \ncustomers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings.

The classification change for all deferred taxes as noncurrent simplifies entities’ processes as \nit eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net noncurrent deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction \nand allocate valuation allowances. We elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter \nof fiscal 2015. Prior periods in our Consolidated Financial Statements were not retrospectively adjusted. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Effective\nOn May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, requiring an entity to \nrecognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The \nupdated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits \nthe use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue \nstandard for periods beginning after December 15, 2016 to December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than \nthe original effective date.

Our hedging policy also establishes maximum limits for each counterparty to mitigate any concentration of risk.\nFair Value Hedging—Hedges of Interest Rate Risks\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps designated as a fair value hedge related to our \n$900 million of 4.75% fixed interest rate senior notes due February 1, 2020 (the “2020 Notes”). In effect, the interest rate swaps \nconvert the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on the LIBOR. Under the terms of the swaps, we \nwill pay monthly interest at the one-month LIBOR rate plus a fixed number of basis points on the $900 million notional amount \nthrough February 1, 2020. In exchange, we will receive 4.75% fixed rate interest from the swap counterparties. See Note 16 for \nfurther details regarding our debt.\nThe interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges and substantially offset the changes in fair value of the hedged \nportion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market risk. Therefore, the gains and losses related to changes \nin the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements \nof Income. The fair value of the interest rate swaps is reflected in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCash Flow Hedging—Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue and Interest Rate Risks\nIn countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and in various other currencies. We may use \nforeign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge certain cash flow exposures resulting from changes in these foreign \ncurrency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter \ninto these foreign exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue in the normal \ncourse of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.\nTo receive hedge accounting treatment, all hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, \nand the hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions.

This instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge. Upon issuance of our $1 billion of 3.25% senior notes due \nFebruary 1, 2025 (the “2025 Notes”) in January 2015, we terminated the instrument and incurred a loss of $16.2 million. This loss \nwas recorded in the stockholders’ equity section in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accumulated other comprehensive income \nand will be reclassified to interest expense over a ten-year term consistent with the impact of the hedged item.

We are \nsubject to the continual examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. Our \nmajor tax jurisdictions are Ireland, California and the United States. For Ireland, California and the United States, the earliest \nfiscal years open for examination are 2008, 2010 and 2010, respectively. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting \nfrom these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and have reserved for potential adjustments \nthat may result from the current examinations. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, there can be no assurance \nthat the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial \nposition.\nThe timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain as are the amounts and timing of tax payments \nthat are part of any audit settlement process. These events could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of \ncurrent and non-current assets and liabilities. We believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that either certain \naudits will conclude or statutes of limitations on certain income tax examination periods will expire, or both.

RESTRUCTURING\nFiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, in order to better align our global resources for Digital Media and Digital Marketing, \nwe initiated a restructuring plan to vacate our Research and Development facility in China and our Sales and Marketing facility \nin Russia. This plan consisted of reductions of approximately 350 full-time positions and we recorded restructuring charges of \napproximately $21.0 million through fiscal 2015 related to ongoing termination benefits for the positions eliminated.

BENEFIT PLANS\nRetirement Savings Plan\nIn 1987, we adopted an Employee Investment Plan, qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which is \na retirement savings plan covering substantially all of our U.S. employees, now referred to as the Adobe 401(k) Retirement Savings \nPlan. Under the plan, eligible employees may contribute up to 65% of their pretax or after-tax salary, subject to the Internal Revenue \nService annual contribution limits. In fiscal 2015, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation. We \ncontributed $25.7 million, $24.8 million and $22.3 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Adobe is under no obligation \nto continue matching future employee contributions and at the Company’s discretion may change its practices at any time.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nOn September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, \neffective December 2, 2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”).

We have the following stock-\nbased compensation plans and programs:\nRestricted Stock Unit Plans\nWe currently grant restricted stock units to eligible employees under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (“2003 \nPlan”). In February 2015, the Executive Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors retired our remaining share reserves \nunder the 2005 Equity Incentive Assumption Plan (“2005 Assumption Plan”). Restricted stock units granted under these plans as \npart of our annual review process vest annually over three years. Other restricted stock units granted under these plans generally \nvest over four years, the majority of which vest 25% annually. Certain grants have other vesting periods approved by our Board \nof Directors or an authorized committee of the Board of Directors.\nWe grant performance awards to officers and key employees under our 2003 Plan. Performance awards granted under this \nplan between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2012 vest annually over three years, and performance awards granted in fiscal 2015, 2014 and \n2013 cliff-vest after three years. \nAs of November 27, 2015, we had reserved 173.2 million shares of common stock for issuance under our 2003 Plan and \nhad 48.5 million shares available for grant.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOur 1997 Employee Stock Purc",

It assigns two tasks: one for extracting the cash from operations and another for extracting total current liabilities. Each task is atomic and focuses on a specific piece of information.\n\n- **transform_outputs**: This function filters and aggregates the outputs from the small language models. It ensures that only jobs with non-empty answers are included. The results are organized by task and chunk, providing a clear view of the extracted information."

A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems \nor third-party hosted services in the event of a major earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power loss, \ntelecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could \ncause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions \nin our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customers’ \norders or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country’s \nor region’s demand for our products.

VSOE of fair value is used to allocate a portion of the price to the \nundelivered elements and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered elements. Absent VSOE, \nrevenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which VSOE of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all elements \nof the arrangement have been delivered. However, if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support, the entire \narrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the \nelements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a \nparticular period.\n\n\n36\nWe determine VSOE for each element based on historical stand-alone sales to third parties or from the stated renewal rate \nfor the elements contained in the initial arrangement. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the selling \nprices for a product or service fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range.\nWe have established VSOE for our software maintenance and support services, custom software development services, \nconsulting services and training, when such services are sold optionally with software licenses.\nFor multiple-element arrangements containing our non-software services, we must: (1) determine whether and when each \nelement has been delivered; (2) determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of VSOE of selling price, \nthird-party evidence (“TPE”) of selling price or best-estimated selling price (“BESP”), as applicable; and (3) allocate the total \nprice among the various elements based on the relative selling price method.\nFor multiple-element arrangements that contain both software and non-software elements, we allocate revenue to software \nor soft",

As of November 28, 2014, we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately $2.19 \nbillion, which has been updated to include $433 million of individual annual subscriptions which were not captured in the prior \nyear due to current year enhancements to our management reporting system. \nWe expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factors, \nincluding the timing and duration of large customer subscription, SaaS and managed service agreements, varying billing cycles \nof these agreements, the timing of customer renewals, the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed, changes \nin customer financial circumstances and foreign currency fluctuations. Additionally, the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for \nmulti-year subscription agreements that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period, lower prior \nto renewal and typically increases when the agreement is renewed. Accordingly, fluctuations in unbilled deferred revenue backlog \nmay not be a reliable indicator of future business prospects and the related revenue associated with these contractual commitments.\n\n\n45\nCost of Revenue (dollars in millions) \n \nFiscal\n2015\nFiscal\n2014\nFiscal\n2013\n% Change\n2015-2014\n% Change\n2014-2013\nSubscription ................................................",

Our desktop \napplication product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price protection. \nOur direct sales and OEM sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly, we reduce revenue recognized for estimated \nfuture returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted \nperiodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors.\nWe recognize OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEMs ship products incorporating our software, provided \ncollection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain OEM customers, we must estimate royalty revenue due to the timing \nof securing customer information. This estimate is based on a combination of our generated forecasts and actual historical reporting \nby our OEM customers. To substantiate our ability to estimate revenue, we review license royalty revenue reports ultimately \nreceived from our significant OEM customers in comparison to the amounts estimated in the prior period.\nOur product-related deferred revenue includes maintenance upgrade revenue and customer advances under OEM license \nagreements. Our maintenance upgrade revenue for our desktop application products is included in our product revenue line item \nas the maintenance primarily entitles customers to receive product upgrades. In cases where we provide a specified free upgrade \nto an existing product, we defer the fair value for the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the \nright to the specified free upgrade expires.\nRights of Return, Rebates and Price Protection\nAs discussed above, we offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies \nand programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as \nan offset to revenue and accounts receivable.

Our desktop \napplication product revenue from distributors is subject to agreements allowing limited rights of return, rebates and price protection. \nOur direct sales and OEM sales are also subject to limited rights of return. Accordingly, we reduce revenue recognized for estimated \nfuture returns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded. The estimates for returns are adjusted \nperiodically based upon historical rates of returns, inventory levels in the distribution channel and other related factors.\nWe recognize OEM licensing revenue, primarily royalties, when OEMs ship products incorporating our software, provided \ncollection of such revenue is deemed probable. For certain OEM customers, we must estimate royalty revenue due to the timing \nof securing customer information. This estimate is based on a combination of our generated forecasts and actual historical reporting \nby our OEM customers. To substantiate our ability to estimate revenue, we review license royalty revenue reports ultimately \nreceived from our significant OEM customers in comparison to the amounts estimated in the prior period.\nOur product-related deferred revenue includes maintenance upgrade revenue and customer advances under OEM license \nagreements. Our maintenance upgrade revenue for our desktop application products is included in our product revenue line item \nas the maintenance primarily entitles customers to receive product upgrades. In cases where we provide a specified free upgrade \nto an existing product, we defer the fair value for the specified upgrade right until the future obligation is fulfilled or when the \nright to the specified free upgrade expires.\nRights of Return, Rebates and Price Protection\nAs discussed above, we offer limited rights of return, rebates and price protection of our products under various policies \nand programs with our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers. We estimate and record reserves for these programs as \nan offset to revenue and accounts receivable.

Foreign exchange option \ncontracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenue are designated as cash flow hedges with gains and losses recorded net of \ntax, as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity and reclassified into revenue at the time the forecasted \ntransactions occur.\nConcentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, \nstructured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables.\nOur investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries and issuers. \nOur cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy. \nOur policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one security issue or issuer and we believe no significant concentration of \ncredit risk exists with respect to these investments.\nWe enter into foreign currency hedge contracts with bank counterparties that could expose us to credit related losses in the \nevent of their nonperformance. This is largely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received \nor posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. In addition, \nwe enter into master netting arrangements which have the ability to further limit credit related losses with the same counterparty \nby permitting net settlement transactions. \nThe aggregate fair value of foreign currency contracts in net asset positions as of November 27, 2015 and November 28, \n2014 was $19.1 million and $33.0 million respectively. These amounts represent the maximum exposure to loss at the reporting \ndate as a result of all of the counterparties failing to perform as contracted. These exposures could be reduced by certain immaterial \nliabilities included in master netting arrangements with those same counterparties. \nCredit risk in receivables is limited to OEMs, dealers and distributors of hardware and software products to the retail market, \ncustomers to whom we license software directly and our SaaS offerings. A credit review is completed for our new distributors, \ndealers and OEMs. We also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our cust",

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES\nHedge Accounting and Hedging Programs\nWe recognize derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets \nand measure them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of \nthe derivative and whether it is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.\nWe evaluate hedge effectiveness at the inception of the hedge prospectively as well as retrospectively and record any \nineffective portion of the hedging instruments in interest and other income, net on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The \nnet gain (loss) recognized in interest and other income (expense), net for cash flow hedges due to hedge ineffectiveness was \ninsignificant for all fiscal years presented. The time value of purchased contracts is recorded in interest and other income (expense), \nnet in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe bank counterparties to these contracts expose us to credit-related losses in the event of their nonperformance which are \nlargely mitigated with collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of \ncertain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually establ",

In fiscal 2015, we matched 50% of the first 6% of the employee’s eligible compensation. We \ncontributed $25.7 million, $24.8 million and $22.3 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Adobe is under no obligation \nto continue matching future employee contributions and at the Company’s discretion may change its practices at any time.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nOn September 21, 2006, the Board of Directors approved the Adobe Systems Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan, \neffective December 2, 2006 (the “Deferred Compensation Plan”).

The effective interest rate \nincluding the discount and issuance costs was 3.45% for the 2015 Notes and is 4.92% for the 2020 Notes.

      "output": "### Analysis\n\n1. **Information Gathered:**\n   - **Cash from Operations:** We have successfully extracted the cash from operations for FY2015 from two chunks. The value is cited as \\$1.47 billion.\n   - **Total Current Liabilities:** We have conflicting information regarding total current liabilities. One chunk suggests a value of \\$456.1 million, while another provides \\$2,213,556. There are also other values mentioned, but they are either not directly labeled as total current liabilities or are inferred from other sections.\n\n2. **Sufficiency of Information:**\n   - We have a clear value for cash from operations, but the information on total current liabilities is conflicting and unclear. Therefore, the information is not sufficient to confidently calculate the operating cash flow ratio.\n\n3. **Missing Information:**\n   - A definitive and consistent value for total current liabilities for FY2015 is missing. We need to resolve the conflicting values and ensure the correct figure is used.\n\n4. **Calculation:**\n   - If we had a consistent and verified value for total current liabilities, we would calculate the operating cash flow ratio by dividing the cash from operations (\\$1.47 billion) by the total current liabilities. The result would then be rounded to two decimal places.\n\n5. **Conflicting Answers:**\n   - The conflicting values for total current liabilities need to be resolved. The value of \\$2,213,556 is directly labeled as \"Total current liabilities\" in one of the citations, which makes it more reliable than the inferred or less directly labeled values. However, further verification is needed to ensure accuracy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo answer the question, we need to verify and confirm the correct value for total current liabilities. Once we have a consistent and accurate figure, we can proceed with the calculation of the operating cash flow ratio."

It generates two types of tasks: one for extracting the cash from operations and another for extracting total current liabilities. Each task is atomic and focuses on a specific piece of information.\n\n- **transform_outputs**: This function filters and aggregates the outputs from the small language models. It filters out jobs with no valid answers and organizes the results by task and chunk. The aggregated string includes the answers, explanations, and citations for each successful job."

We enter into these investments with the intent of securing financial \nreturns as well as for strategic purposes as they often increase our knowledge of emerging markets and technologies, as well as \nexpand our opportunities to provide Adobe products and services. \nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT\n \nAs the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, a continuous high level of investment is required \nfor the enhancement of existing products and services and the development of new products and services. We develop our software \ninternally as well as acquire products or technology developed by others by purchasing the stock or assets of the business entity \nthat owned the technology. In other instances, we have licensed or purchased the intellectual property ownership rights of programs \ndeveloped by others with license or technology transfer agreements that may obligate us to pay a flat license fee or royalties, \ntypically based on a dollar amount per unit shipped or a percentage of the revenue generated by those programs.\nDuring fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, our research and development expenses were $862.7 million, $844.4 million and $826.6 \nmillion, respectively.\nPRODUCT PROTECTION\nWe regard our software as proprietary and protect it under the laws of copyrights, patents, trademarks and trade secrets. \nWe have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and \ntechnology. While we believe our patents have value, no single patent is material to us or to any of our reporting segments. We \nprotect the source code of our software programs as trade secrets and make source code available to third parties only under limited \ncircumstances and subject to specific security and confidentiality constraints. From time to time, we secure rights to third-party \nintellectual property if beneficial to our business.\nOur products are generally licensed to end users under one of the following two methods:\n(1) We offer products on a “right to use” basis pursuant to a license that restricts the use of the products to a designated \nnumber of devices, users or both.

A \nnumber of factors may affect the market price for our common stock, including:\n• \nshortfalls in our revenue, margins, earnings, the number of paid Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscribers, \nAnnualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”), bookings within our Adobe Marketing Cloud business or other key \nperformance metrics;\n• \nchanges in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n• \nwhether our results meet analysts’ expectations\n• \nthe announcement of new products and services, product enhancements or service introductions by us or our competitors;\n• \nthe loss of large customers or our inability to increase sales to existing customers, retain customers or attract new \ncustomers;\n• \nvariations in our or our competitors’ results of operations, changes in the competitive landscape generally and \ndevelopments in our industry; and\n• \nunusual events such as significant acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, general socio-economic, regulatory, political or \nmarket conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance. \nWe are subject to risks associated with compliance with laws and regulations globally which may harm our business.\nWe are a global company subject to varied and complex laws, regulations and customs, both domestically and internationally. \nThese laws and regulations relate to a number of aspects of our business, including trade protection, import and export control, \ndata and transaction processing security, p",

We determine \nthe selling price for each deliverable using VSOE of selling price, if it exists, or TPE of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE \nof selling price exist for a deliverable, we use BESP. Once revenue is allocated to software or software-related elements as a group, \nwe recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance. Revenue is recognized when revenue recognition \ncriteria are met for each element.\nWe are generally unable to establish VSOE or TPE for non-software elements and as such, we use BESP. BESP is generally \nused for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand-alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings. We determine BESP \nfor a product or service by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, major product groupings, geographies, market \nconditions, competitive landscape, internal costs, gross margin objectives and pricing practices. Pricing practices taken into \nconsideration include historic contractually stated prices, volume discounts where applicable and our price lists. We must estimate \ncertain royalty revenue amounts due to the timing of securing information from our customers. While we believe we can make \nreliable estimates regarding these matters, these estimates are inherently subjective. Accordingly, our assumptions and judgments \nregarding future products and services as well as our estimates of royalty revenue could differ from actual events, thus materially \nimpacting our financial position and results of operations.\nProduct revenue is recognized when the above criteria are met. We reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future \nreturns, price protection and rebates at the time the related revenue is recorded.

The three Creative Cloud offerings address the multiple \nroutes to market we use to license our creative software to targeted customers. Adoption of Creative Cloud has transformed our \nbusiness model, and we continue to expect this to drive higher long-term revenue growth through an expansion of our customer \nbase by acquiring new users through a lower cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value, as well as keeping existing \ncustomers current on our latest release. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers, most notably with \nour acquisition of Fotolia in January of 2015, to enable the delivery and purchase of stock assets in our new service called Adobe \nStock.  Overall, our strategy with Creative Cloud is designed to enable us to increase our revenue with users, attract more new \ncustomers, and shift our revenue to be more recurring and predictable as revenue is recognized ratably.\nWe continue to implement strategies that will accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our \nCreative Cloud offering. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive such as offering new mobile \napplications, as well as targeted promotions and offers that attract past customers and potential users to try out and ultimately \nsubscribe to Creative Cloud.

Starting in fiscal 2014, we eliminated the use of non-qualified stock options for our non-employee directors and restricted \nstock units became the primary form of their annual equity grants. \nRestricted stock units granted to directors for fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):\n \n2015\n2014\n2013\nRestricted stock units granted to existing directors....................................................\n41\n48\n36\nRestricted stock units granted to new directors..........................................................\n—\n—\n14\n\n\nADOBE SYSTEMS INCORPORATED\n NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n93\nAs part of the annual equity awards process in 2013, there were approximately 25 thousand options granted to non-employee \ndirectors with a $45.03 exercise price, equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. These options \nvested 100% on the day preceding the fiscal 2014 annual meeting and had a seven-year term.\nCompensation Costs\nWe recognize the estimated compensation cost of restricted stock units, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis \nover the requisite service period of the entire award, which is generally the vesting period. The estimated compensation cost is \nbased on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant.\nWe recognize the estimated compensation cost of performance shares, net of estimated forfeitures. The fiscal 2015, 2014 \nand 2013 awards are earned upon achievement of an objective total stockholder return measure at the end of the three-year \nperformance period, as described above, and are valued using a Monte Carlo Simulation model. The fair value of the awards was \nfixed at grant date and amortized over the longer of the remaining performance or service period. For the fiscal 2012 performance \nshares, expense is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each vesting tranche of the award.\nAs of November 27, 2015, there was $394.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, \nrelated to non-vested stock-based awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.5 years. Total unrecognized \ncompensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures. \nTotal stock-based compensation costs that have been included in our Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal 2015, \n2014 and 2013 were as follows (in thousands):\n \n  Income Statement Classifications\n \nCost of\nRevenue–\nSubscription\nCost of\nRevenue–\nServices and \nSupport\nResearch and\nDevelopment\nSales and\nMarketing\nGeneral and\nAdministrative\n \nTotal(1)\nOption Grants and Stock\nPurchase Rights\n \n \n \n \n \n \n2015................................................... $\n1,449\n$\n5,185\n$\n14,082\n$\n18,360\n$\n4,790\n$\n43,866\n2014................................................... $\n1,855\n$\n4,000\n$\n15,125\n$\n17,706\n$\n6,476\n$\n45,162\n2013................................................",

As of November 27, 2015, the carrying value of the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower \napproximated fair value. Under the agreement for the Almaden Tower, we have the option to purchase the building at any time \nduring the lease term for $103.6 million. If we purchase the building, the investment in the lease receivable may be credited against \nthe purchase price.

In the case of a default, the lessor may \ndemand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. \nIf we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building \nto an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, \nup to the residual value guarantee amount less our investment in lease receivable.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n Lease Commitments\nWe lease certain of our facilities and some of our equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements that expire \nat various dates through 2028. We also have one land lease that expires in 2091. Rent expense includes base contractual rent and \nvariable costs such as building expenses, utilities, taxes, insurance and equipment rental. Rent expense for these leases was \napproximately $92.9 million, $111.1 million, and $119.0 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. Our sublease income was immaterial \nfor all periods presented.\nWe occupy three office buildings in San Jose, California where our corporate headquarters are located. We reference these \noffice buildings as the Almaden Tower and the East and West Towers. We own the land and the East and West Tower buildings, \nand lease the Almaden Tower building. See Note 6 for discussion of our East and West Towers purchase.\nThe lease agreement for the Almaden Tower is effective through March 2017. We are the investors in the lease receivable \nrelated to the Almaden Tower lease in the amount of $80.4 million, which is recorded as investment in lease receivable on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets. As of November 27, 2015, the carrying value of the lease receivable related to the Almaden Tower \napproximated fair value. Under the agreement for the Almaden Tower, we have the option to purchase the building at any time \nduring the lease term for $103.6 million. If we purchase the building, the investment in the lease receivable may be credited against \nthe purchase price. The residual value guarantee under the Almaden Tower obligation is $89.4 million. \nThe Almaden Tower lease is subject to standard covenants including a certain financial ratio that is reported to the lessor \nquarterly. As of November 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all of the covenants. In the case of a default, the lessor may \ndemand we purchase the building for an amount equal to the lease balance, or require that we remarket or relinquish the building. \nIf we choose to remarket or are required to do so upon relinquishing the building, we are bound to arrange the sale of the building \nto an unrelated party and will be required to pay the lessor any shortfall between the net remarketing proceeds and the lease balance, \nup to the residual value guarantee amount less our investment in lease receivable.

In this case, we find a table labeled 'Contractual Obligations' with a column 'Less than 1 year'. This column represents 'total current liabilities' as it includes all obligations due within one year.\n   Citation: Total\nLess than\n1 year\n$456.1\n\n### Chunk # 88\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 89\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 90\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 91\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 92\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`185`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: Total current liabilities value was not found under sections labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar.\n\n### Chunk # 93\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`187`):\n   Answer: $2,213,556\n   Explanation: I extracted the 'total current liabilities' value from the 'Current liabilities' section of the statement of financial position.\n   Citation: Total current liabilities....................................................................................................\n2,213,556\n$2,494,435\n\n### Chunk # 94\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`189`):\n   Answer: 4,724,892\n   Explanation: Total liabilities include both current and non-current liabilities. Since there's no separate section for current liabilities, we'll consider total liabilities as a proxy. However, please note that this might include non-current liabilities as well.\n   Citation: Total liabilities\n4,724,892\n4,009,924\n\n### Chunk # 95\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 96\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 97\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 98\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`197`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar was found.

I found 'Accrued expenses' which seems to be a type of current liability. I extracted the value '$2,154' from this section as it represents 'Total liabilities'.\n   Citation: Accrued expenses:\n\nForeign currency derivatives................................ $2,154\n$—\n$2,154\n$—\nTotal liabilities............................................................. $2,154\n$—\n$2,154\n$—\n\n### Chunk # 116\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 117\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 118\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 119\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`239`):\n   Answer: 663\n   Explanation: To find 'total current liabilities', we should look for sections labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar. However, since 'total current liabilities' isn't directly stated in this section of the document, we can infer that 'Total derivatives' under 'Derivatives designated as hedging instruments' and 'Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments' includes both current and non-current liabilities. Therefore, we can look for 'Total derivatives' under 'Derivatives' and find '663' under 'Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments' which seems to be a current liability.\n   Citation: Derivatives designated as hedging instruments:\n\nForeign exchange option contracts (1)(3) ................... $16,979\n—\n$31,275\n—\nInterest rate swap (2) .................................................\n19,821\n—\n14,268\n—\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\n Foreign exchange forward contracts (1)....................\n2,147\n2,154\n1,716\n663\nTotal derivatives .......................................................... $38,947\n$2,154\n$47,259\n$663\n\n### Chunk # 120\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 121\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 122\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 123\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`247`):\n   Answer: $241,984\n   Explanation: Total current liabilities value was extracted from 'Total current' section under 'Current' category of 'provision for income taxes' for fiscal 2015.\n   Citation: Total current:\n\nUnited States federal ..............................................................\n$204,834\nForeign ...................................................................................................\n52,125\nState and local ...........................................................................................\n(14,975)\nTotal current...................................................................................................\n241,984\n\n### Chunk # 124\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 125\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 126\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 127\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`255`):\n   Answer: $148,848\n   Explanation: I extracted the 'total current liabilities' value from the statement of financial position by looking for sections labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar. In this case, I found 'Ending balance' which corresponds to 'Current Liabilities'.\n   Citation: $148,848\nEnding balance\n\n### Chunk # 128\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`257`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar was found. However, we can infer that 'Accrued restructuring charges' might be a part of current liabilities. But without further breakdown or classification into current and non-current liabilities, we cannot accurately determine 'total current liabilities'.\n\n### Chunk # 129\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`259`):\n   Answer: $39.6 million\n   Explanation: I looked for sections labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar. However, I found a section labeled 'long-term liabilities' which indicates undistributed deferred compensation due to employees. Since it's long-term liabilities and not current liabilities, I extracted the value as it's likely related to current liabilities but under a different label.\n   Citation: As of November 27, 2015 and November 28, 2014, $39.6 million and $31.0 million, respectively, was recorded as long-term liabilities to recognize undistributed deferred compensation due to employees.\n\n### Chunk # 130\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 131\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 132\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 133\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 134\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 135\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 136\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 137\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 138\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 139\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 140\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 141\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 142\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`285`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: There's no section labeled 'Current Liabilities' or similar.

In this case, we find 'Less: current portion' which indicates a subtraction from total debt and capital lease obligations. This subtraction gives us the current portion of debt and capital lease obligations which can be considered as total current liabilities.\n   Citation: Less: current portion............................................................................................................... — 603,229 Debt and capital lease obligations........................................................................................ $1,907,231 $ 911,086\n\n### Chunk # 146\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 147\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 148\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 149\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 150\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 151\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 152\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`305`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No 'Current Liabilities' or similar section was found in the given document excerpt.\n\n### Chunk # 153\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 154\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`309`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No 'Current Liabilities' or similar section was found in the given document excerpt.\n\n### Chunk # 155\n   -- Job 1 (job_id=`311`):\n   Answer: None\n   Explanation: No 'Current Liabilities' section or similar was found in the given document excerpt.\n\n### Chunk # 156\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 157\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 158\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n### Chunk # 159\n   No jobs returned successfully for this chunk.\n\n-----------------------\n\n\n\nReturn a single JSON object with no triple backticks or extra text.
