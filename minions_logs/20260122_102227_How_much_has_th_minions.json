Total length: 500564 characters.: \n\n## Question\nHow much has the effective tax rate of Corning changed between FY2021 and FY2022?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 500564 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To determine the change in Corning's effective tax rate between FY2021 and FY2022, focus on extracting specific financial data from the document. Identify the sections that discuss the company's tax expenses and pre-tax income for both fiscal years. Look for tables or notes in the financial statements that detail the effective tax rate or provide the necessary figures to calculate it. Pay attention to the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section, as it often provides insights into changes in tax rates and the factors influencing them. Additionally, review any commentary on tax strategies or changes in tax legislation that might have impacted the effective tax rate. This information will allow you to compare the effective tax rates for the two fiscal years and determine the change."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Since that milestone, we have continued to pioneer optical fiber, cable and connectivity solutions. As\nglobal demand driven by video usage grows exponentially, telecommunications networks continue to migrate from copper to optical-based systems that can deliver the\nrequired cost-effective capacity. Our experience puts us in a unique position to design and deliver optical solutions that reach every edge of the communications network.\nThe Optical Communications segment is divided into two main product groupings – carrier network and enterprise network. The carrier network group consists\nprimarily of products and solutions for optical-based communications infrastructure for services such as video, data and voice communications. The enterprise network\ngroup consists primarily of optical-based communication networks sold to businesses, governments and individuals for their own use.\n2\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur carrier network product portfolio encompasses an array of optical fiber products, including Vascade® optical fibers for use in submarine networks; LEAF® optical\nfiber for long-haul, regional and metropolitan networks; SMF-28® ULL and TXF® fiber for more scalable long-haul and regional networks; SMF-28e+™ single-mode\noptical fiber providing additional transmission wavelengths in metropolitan and access networks and ClearCurve® ultra-bendable single-mode fiber for use in multiple-\ndwelling units and fiber-to-the-home applications.  For high performance across the range of long-haul, metro, access and fiber-to-the-home network applications, SMF-\n28® Ultra and SMF-28® Contour fibers deliver industry-leading attenuation, compatibility and improved macrobend performance in one fiber. A portion of our optical\nfiber is sold directly to end users and third-party cablers globally. Our remaining fiber production is cabled internally and sold to end users as either bulk cable or as part\nof an integrated optical solution. Our cable products, including the RocketRibbon® and miniXtend® portfolios, support various outdoor, indoor/outdoor and indoor\napplications and include a broad range of loose tube, ribbon and drop cable designs with flame-retardant versions available for indoor and indoor/outdoor use includin",

Therefore, management utilizes constant-currency reporting for Display\nTechnologies, Specialty Materials, Environmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact from the Japanese yen, South Korean won, Chinese\nyuan, new Taiwan dollar and the euro, as applicable to the segment.

These measures are not, and should not be viewed as a substitute for, GAAP reporting\nmeasures. With respect to the outlook for future periods, it is not possible to provide reconciliations for these non-GAAP measures because management does not\nforecast the movement of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar, or other items that do not reflect ongoing operations, nor does it forecast items that have not yet\noccurred or are out of management's control.

This requires us to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following estimates are considered\nby management to be the most critical to the understanding of the consolidated financial statements as they require significant judgments that could materially\nimpact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nValuation of the Previously Held Equity Interest from the Consolidation of HSG\nWe account for the change in controlling interest using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities\nrecorded.  Assets would include intangible assets such as developed technologies and know-how, tradenames and customer-related intangibles, fixed assets and\ninventories. Liabilities would include contract liabilities such as customer deposits and deferred revenue, debt and other liabilities. These assets and liabilities recorded\nare assessed at the time of the change in control and require judgment in ascertaining the fair values. Any resulting gain or loss would be recognized in\nearnings. Additional information related to the fair value of the assets and liabilities recorded during the measurement period, not to exceed one year, may result in\nchanges to the recorded values of the assets and liabilities, resulting in an offsetting adjustment to the goodwill associated with the business combination. Changes in\nassumptions and estimates after completing the allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired, as well as differences in actual and estimated results,\ncould result in impacts our financial results.\nIn September 2020, HSG redeemed DuPont’s entire ownership interest in HSG for $250 million (the “Redemption”).

We used a discount rate of 16.5% and terminal growth rate of zero.\nImpairment of assets held for use\nWe are required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. We perform this review each\nquarter and exercises judgment in assessing whether impairment indicators are present.\nManufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals, primarily platinum and rhodium. These metals\nare not depreciated because they have very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in our manufacturing process over a very long useful life. The\nphysical loss of precious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process is treated as depletion and these losses are accounted for as a period expense based on\nactual units lost. Precious metals are reviewed for impairment as part of our assessment of long-lived assets. This review considers all our precious metals that are either\nin place in the production process; in reclamation, fabrication, or refinement in anticipation of re-use; or awaiting use to support increased capacity. Precious metals are\nonly acquired to support our operations and are not held for trading or other non-manufacturing related purposes.\nExamples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairments include, but are not limited to:\n•\nA significant decrease in the market price of an asset;\n•\nA significant change in the use of a long-lived asset or its physical condition;\n•\nA significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a\nregulator;\n•\nAn accumulation of costs significantly more than the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of an asset;\n•\nA current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses\nassociated with the use of an asset; and\n•\nA current expectation that, more likely than not, an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\n39\n\n\nTable of Contents\nFor purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss, a long-lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which\nidentifiable cash flows are largely independent of t",

We must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which\nidentifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Our assessment is performed at the operating segment level. For most of\nour operating segments, we concluded that locations or businesses within these segments which share production along the supply chain must be combined to\nappropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities.\nFor long-lived assets, when impairment indicators are present, we compare estimated undiscounted future cash flows, including the eventual disposition of the asset\ngroup at market value, to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. This assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the\nfuture use of and projected value to be derived from the assets to be held and used. Assessments also consider changes in asset utilization, including the temporary idling\nof capacity and the expected timing for placing this capacity back into production.\nFor an asset group that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an “income approach” that starts with the forecast\nof all the expected future net cash flows, including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious\nmetals, if applicable. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value. Our estimates are based upon\nour historical experience, our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends. We believe fair value assessments are most sensitive to\nmarket growth and the corresponding impact on volume and selling prices and that these are also more subjective than manufacturing cost and other assumptions. We\nbelieve our current assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment and reprioritization of\nresearch and development programs relating to a business within Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Given the economic environment and market\nopportunities, we discontinued our investment in these research and development programs. The impairment analysis and disposition of certain assets resulted in a total\npre-tax charge of $217 million, which was substantially all the carrying value, inclusive of an insignificant amount of goodwill. The fair value of the asset group for the\nimpairment analysis was measured using unobservable (Level 3) inputs.\nRefer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits) in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation.\nIncome taxes\nWe are ",

It is possible that actual results will\ndiffer from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that companies only record tax benefits for technical positions\nthat are believed to have a greater than 50% likelihood of being sustained on their technical merits and then only to the extent of the amount of tax benefit that is greater\nthan 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. In estimating these amounts, we must exercise judgment around factors such as the weighting of the tax law in our\nfavor, the willingness of a tax authority to aggressively pursue an opposing position, or alternatively, consider a negotiated compromise, and our willingness to dispute a\ntax authorities’ assertion to the level of appeal we believe is required to sustain our position.

Observable inputs are based on market data or\nindependent sources, while unobservable inputs are based on our own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, we prioritize the inputs used to measure\nfair value into one of three broad levels. Characterization of fair value inputs is required for those accounting pronouncements that prescribe or permit fair value\nmeasurement. In addition, observable market data must be used when available and the highest-and-best-use measure should be applied to non-financial assets. Our\nmajor categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short-term and long-term investments, certain pension asset investments and\nderivatives. These categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in\nwhich there are few transactions.\nDerivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts that are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and\nliabilities. Included in our forward exchange contracts are foreign currency hedges that hedge our cash flow and translation exposure resulting from movements in the\nJapanese yen, South Korean won, euro, new",

We seek to mitigate the\nimpact of exchange rate movements in our income statement by using over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative instruments including foreign exchange forward and option\ncontracts. In general, these hedges expire coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.\nWe are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts. However, we minimize this risk by maintaining a\ndiverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions as our counterparties. We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default. Neither we\nnor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.\nOur cash flow hedging activities utilize OTC foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that movements in exchange rates will adversely affect the net cash\nflows resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers. We also use OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts\nthat are not designated as hedged instruments. These contracts are used to offset economic currency risks. The undesignated hedges limit exposure to foreign functional\ncurrency fluctuations related to certain subsidiaries’ monetary assets, monetary liabilities and net earnings in foreign currencies. A significant portion of our non-U.S.\nrevenue is denominated in Japanese yen. When this revenue is translated back to U.S. dollars, we are exposed to foreign exchange rate movements in the Japanese yen.\nTo protect translated earnings against movements in the Japanese yen, we have entered into a series of average rate forwards and other derivative instruments.\nWe use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with foreign currency exposure. Market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and\nliabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates. As of December 31, 2022, with respect to open foreign exchange forward and option\ncontracts and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements, a 10% adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could\nresult in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $0.8 billion compared to $0.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. Specific to the Japanese yen, a 10% adverse\nmovement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.

Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities\nand Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements,\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and\noperating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the\ncircumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the\npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally acce",

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness\nto future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or\nrequired to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii)\ninvolved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the\nconsolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit\nmatter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIncome Taxes - Receivables for South Korean Tax Disputes\nAs described in Notes 1, 7, and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, in evaluating the tax benefits associated with the Company’s various tax filing positions,\nmanagement records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to\nthe asset or liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company files the return containing the tax position or when new information becomes\navailable. The Company is currently appealing certain South Korean tax assessments and tax refund claims for tax years 2010 through 2018. The Company is required to\ndeposit the disputed tax amounts with the South Korean government as a condition of its appeal of any tax assessment. The Company believes that it is more likely than\nnot that the Company will prevail in the appeals process and as a result, management recorded a non-current receivable of $349 million as of December 31, 2022.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the receivables for South Korean tax disputes is a critical audit matter are (i) the\nsignificant judgment by management when applying the more-likely-than-not recognition criteria to the Company’s uncertain tax positions based on the application of\nthe tax law; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivit",

These procedures also included, among others, obtaining management’s assessment and evidence supporting the more-likely-than-not tax position on the\nSouth Korean tax disputes and evaluating the reasonableness of the likelihood that the tax positions will ultimately be sustained upon examination by the South Korean\ntax authorities and through the appeals process. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating management’s assessment and\nsupporting evidence related to the application of the tax law.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 13, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1944.\n \n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Income \nCorning Incorporated and Subsidiary Companies\n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n(in millions, except per share amounts)\n \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \n2020\n \nNet sales\n  $\n14,189    $\n14,082    $\n11,303 \nCost of sales\n   \n9,683     \n9,019     \n7,772 \n     \n       \n       \n \nGross margin\n   \n4,506     \n5,063     \n3,531 \n     \n       \n       \n \nOperating expenses:\n     \n       \n       \n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n   \n1,898     \n1,827     \n1,747 \nResearch, development and engineering expenses\n   \n1,047     \n995     \n1,154 \nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n   \n123     \n129     \n121 \n     \n       \n       \n \nOperating income\n   \n1,438     \n2,112     \n509 \n     \n       \n       \n \nInterest income\n   \n15     \n11     \n15 \nInterest expense\n   \n(292)    \n(300)    \n(276)\nTranslated earnings contract gain (loss), net (Note 14)\n   \n351     \n354     \n(38)\nTransaction-related gain, net (Note 3)\n   \n      \n     \n498 \nOther income (expense), net\n   \n285     \n249     \n(74)\n     \n       \n       \n \nIncome before income taxes\n   \n1,797     \n2,426     \n634 \nProvision for income taxes (Note 7)\n   \n(411)    \n(491)    \n(111)\n     \n       \n       \n \nNet income\n   \n1,386     \n1,935     \n523 \n     \n       \n       \n \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interest\n   \n(70)    \n(29)    \n(11)\n     \n       \n       \n \nNet income attributable to Corning Incorporated\n  $\n1,316    $\n1,906    $\n512 \n     \n       \n       \n \nEarnings per common share available to common shareholders:\n     \n       \n       \n \nBasic (Note 17)\n  $\n1.56    $\n1.30    $\n0.54 \nDiluted (Note 17)\n  $\n1.54    $\n1.28    $\n0.54 \n     \n       \n       \n \nReconciliation of net inco",

In these notes, the terms “Corning,”\n“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” mean Corning Incorporated and subsidiary companies.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Corning Incorporated and its subsidiaries that are consolidated in conformity with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany accounts, transactions and profits have been eliminated. Investments in\npartially-owned affiliates are accounted for by the equity method when the Company exercises significant influence, which typically occurs when its ownership interest\nexceeds 20% and the Company does not have a controlling interest. The Company’s share of earnings or losses of these affiliated companies is included in the\nconsolidated operating results.\nThe Company consolidates variable interest entities (“VIEs”) when it has the power to direct the significant activities of the entity and the obligation to absorb losses or\nreceive benefits from the entity that may be significant. The Company did not have any material consolidated or nonconsolidated VIEs in its operations for the presented\nreporting periods.\nOn September 9, 2020, Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”) redeemed the entire ownership interest of DuPont in HSG with a value of $250 million (the\n“Redemption”).  Upon completion of the Redemption, Corning obtained a 100% interest in HS LLC and an 80.5% interest in HSO LLC, which are affiliated entities\nwithin HSG.  Since September 9, 2020, HSG’s results have been consolidated in Corning’s consolidated financial statements and included within Hemlock and\nEmerging Growth Businesses.  Refer to Note 3 (HSG Transactions and Acquisitions) in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on the results of operations,\nfinancial position, or changes in shareholders’ equity.\n \nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue, expenses and the disclosure ",

Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be different from these estimates.\n \n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition \nMost of the Company’s revenue is generated by delivery of products to customers and recognized at a point in time based on evaluation of when the customer obtains\ncontrol of the products. Revenue is recognized when all performance obligations under the terms of a contract are satisfied and control of the product has been\ntransferred to the customer. If customer acceptance clauses are present and it cannot be objectively determined that control has been transferred, revenue is only recorded\nwhen customer acceptance is received and all performance obligations have been satisfied. Sales of goods typically do not include multiple product and/or service\nelements. Shipping and handling fees are treated as fulfillment costs and not as separate performance obligations under the terms of revenue contracts due to the\nperfunctory nature of the shipping and handling obligations.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration expected in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Sales tax, value-added tax and other taxes are\ncollected concurrently with revenue-producing activities and excluded from revenue. Incidental contract costs that are not material in the context of the delivery of goods\nand services are recognized as an expense.\nAt the time revenue is recognized, allowances are recorded with the related reduction to revenue for estimated product returns, allowances and price discounts based\nupon historical experience and related terms of customer arrangements. Where product warranties are offered, liabilities are established for estimated warranty costs\nbased upon historical experience and specific warranty provisions. Warranty liabilities are adjusted when experience indicates the expected outcome will differ from\ninitial estimates of the liability. Product warranty liabilities were not material as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nIn addition, the Company has contractual arrangements with certain customers, mainly related to Telecommunications products and comprised of design, installation,\ntraining and software maintenance services, in",

The performance obligations under these contracts generally require services to be\nperformed over time, resulting in either a straight-line amortization method or an input method using incurred and forecasted expense to predict revenue recognition\npatterns which follows satisfaction of the performance obligation. Corning’s other revenue was not material for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets, such as incremental costs to obtain or fulfill contracts, are an insignificant component of Corning’s revenue recognition process. Most of Corning’s\nfulfillment costs as a manufacturer of products are classified as inventory, fixed assets and intangible assets, which are accounted for under the respective guidance for\nthose asset types. Other fulfillment costs are immaterial due to the nature of the products and their respective manufacturing processes.\nContract liabilities include customer deposits, deferred revenue and other advanced payments. Customer deposits are primarily related to Display products and deferred\nrevenue is primarily related to HSG. Other advanced payments are not significant to operations and are recorded within other accrued liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. Research and development costs totaled $0.9 billion, $0.8 billion and $1.0 billion for the years\nended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n \nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nThe determination of the functional currency for Corning’s foreign subsidiaries is made based on the appropriate economic factors. For most foreign operations, the local\ncurrencies are generally considered to be the functional currencies. Corning’s most significant exception is a Taiwanese subsidiary, which uses the Japanese yen as its\nfunctional currency. For all transactions denominated in a currency other than a subsidiary’s functional currency, foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses are\nincluded in income for the period in which the exchange rates changed. A net foreign currency remeasurement gain of $130 million, gain of $126 million and loss of $37\nmillion was recorded for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. \n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\n \nForeign subsidiary functional currency balance sheet accounts have been translated at period-end exchange rates, and statement of operations accounts have been\ntranslated using average exchange rates for the period.

Upon sale or substantially complete liquidation of an investment in a foreign entity, the amount of net translation gains\nor losses that have been accumulated in other comprehensive loss attributable to that investment are reported as a gain or loss for the period in which the sale or\nliquidation occurs.\n \nShare-Based Compensation\nCorning maintains long-term incentive plans (the “Plans”) for key employees and non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The Plans are established to grant\nequity-based compensation awards, including time-based restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, stock options, stock\nappreciation rights or a combination of awards (collectively, “share-based awards”).\nShare-based compensation cost is allocated to cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses and research, development and engineering expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of income. \nThe cost of share-based compensation awards is equal to the fair value of the award at the grant date and compensation expense is recognized for awards expected to\nultimately vest. The number of awards expected to vest equals the total awards granted less an estimation of the number of forfeitures expected to occur prior to\nvesting. The Company reassesses the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjusts share-based compensation expense based on its probability assessment.\nThe forfeiture rate is calculated based on over 15 years of historical data and is adjusted if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimates. The effect of\nany change in estimated forfeitures would be recognized through a cumulative adjustment that would be included in compensation cost in the period of the change in\nestimate. For awards containing retirement provisions that are granted to retirement eligible employees, share-based compensation expense is recognized over the period\nin which the required performance is expected to be met.\nDuring the requisite service period, the Company also recognizes a deferred income tax benefit for the expense recognized. At the time of subsequent vesting, exercise,\nforfeiture, or expiration of an award, the difference between the Company’s actual income tax deduction, if any, and the previously accrued income tax benefit is\nrecognized in income tax expense/benefit during the current period.\nTime-Based Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units\nTime-based restricted stock and restricted stock units are issued by the Company on a discretionary basis, and are payable in shares of the Company’s common stock\nupon vesting.

The fair value is based on the closing market price of the Company’s common stock on the grant date and assumes that the target\npayout level will be achieved. \n \n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nStock Options\nCorning’s stock option plans provide non-qualified and incentive stock options to purchase authorized but unissued common shares, or treasury shares, at the closing\nmarket price on the grant date and generally become exercisable in tranches from one year to five years from the grant date. The maximum term of non-qualified and\nincentive stock options is 10 years from the grant date. An award is considered vested when the employee’s retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing\nsubsequent service (the “non-substantive vesting period approach”).\nCorning uses a multiple-point Black-Scholes valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options, which incorporates assumptions including expected volatility,\ndividend yield, risk-free rate, expected term and forfeiture rates. Corning utilizes a blended approach for calculating the volatility assumption, which is based on the\nweighted average of the short-term implied volatility, the most recent volatility for the period equal to the expected term and the most recent 15-year historical volatility.\nThe risk-free rate used is the implied rate for a zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bond with a term equal to the option’s expected term. The expected term is the period the\noptions are expected to be outstanding and is calculated using a combination of historical exercise experience adjusted to reflect the current vesting period of options\nbeing valued and partial life cycles of outstanding options.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. Securities with contractual maturities of three months or less, when\npurchased, are considered cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\nThe following table presents supplemental disclosures of cash flow information (in millions):\n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \n2020\n \nNon-cash transactions:\n     \n       \n       \n \nAccruals for capital expenditures\n  $\n414    $\n357    $\n231 \nCash paid for interest and income taxes:\n     \n       \n       \n \nInterest (1)\n  $\n275    $\n287    $\n298 \nIncome taxes, net of refunds received\n  $\n426    $\n377    $\n220 \n(1)\nIncludes approximately $48 million, $36 million and $58 million of interest costs that were capitalized as part of property, pl",

The Company\ndetermines the allowance based on historical write-off experience and expected future default rate by industry. In addition, in circumstances where the Company is made\naware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is established. The Company does not have any significant off-balance-\nsheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net of Accumulated Depreciation\nLand, buildings and equipment, including precious metals, are recorded at cost. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the respective assets using the\nstraight-line method. The estimated useful lives generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 20 years for equipment, excluding precious\nmetals as discussed below. Interest on borrowings is capitalized during the active construction period of major capital projects, added to the cost of the underlying assets\nand amortized over the useful lives of the assets.\n66\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nIncluded in the subcategory of equipment are the following types of assets (excluding precious metals):\nAsset type\n \nRange of useful life\n(in years)\n \nComputer hardware and software\n \n3 to 7\n \nManufacturing equipment\n \n2 to 15\n \nFurniture and fixtures\n \n5 to 10\n \nTransportation equipment\n \n3 to 20\n \nManufacturing equipment includes certain components of production equipment that are constructed of precious metals. These assets are not depreciated because they\nhave very low physical losses and are repeatedly reclaimed and reused in the Company’s manufacturing processes over a very long useful life. The physical loss of\nprecious metals in the manufacturing and reclamation process is treated as depletion and these losses are accounted for as a period expense based on actual units lost.\nPrecious metals are integral to many glass production processes and are only acquired to support operations. These metals are not held for trading or other purposes.\nLeases\nCorning leases certain real estate, vehicles and equipment from third parties, which are classified as operating or finance leases.  Right-of-use assets represent the\nCompany’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.

To determine the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on the lease\ncommencement date or the implicit rate if it is readily determinable. The Company has elected to combine lease and non-lease components of a contract for its leases. \nRenewal and termination options are included in the calculation of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when considered to be reasonably certain to be exercised.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term for operating leases.  Interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use assets relating to\nfinance leases are calculated and recognized using the effective interest and straight-line methods, respectively.   \nCorning does not have any significant agreements as a lessor.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe recoverability of long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, is reviewed when events or changes in circumstances occur that\nindicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. When impairment indicators are present, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows,\nincluding the eventual disposition of the asset group at market value, is compared to the assets’ carrying value to determine if the asset group is recoverable. For an asset\ngroup that fails the test of recoverability, the estimated fair value of long-lived assets is determined using an income approach that starts with the forecast of all the\nexpected future net cash flows, including the eventual disposition at market value of long-lived assets, and considers the fair market value of all precious metals, if\napplicable. The recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the\ncash flows of other assets and liabilities. If there is an impairment, a loss is recorded to reflect the difference between the assets’ fair value and carrying value.\nThe Company is required to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long-lived assets when an indicator of impairment has been identified. The Company\nperforms this review each quarter and exercises judgment in assessing whether impairment indicators are present. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Corning\nincurred a long-lived asset impairment and disposal loss for an asset group related to the reassessment and reprioritization of research and development programs\nrelating to a business within Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses. Refer to Note 2 (Restructuring, Impairment and Other Charges and Credits) in the notes to the\nconsolidated financial statements for additional information.\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in",

For environmental matters, the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with\nrespect to each individual site, current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience. For sites with multiple potentially responsible parties, the Company\nconsiders its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill obligations in establishing a provision for those\ncosts. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another, the minimum undiscounted amount is accrued. When future liabilities are\ndetermined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage, an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the insurance\nreimbursement when reimbursement is virtually certain.\nThe uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates may not reflect the outcome could result in additional costs being recognized\nby the Company in future periods.\nEquity Method Investments\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Corning had investments in affiliated companies accounted for by the equity method totaling $261 million and $264 million,\nrespectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 Corning had sales to affiliated companies of $228 million, $312 million and $253 million,\nrespectively.\n68\n\n\nTable of Contents\n1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying amount may be\nimpaired. This assessment is based on a review of the equity investments’ performance and a review of indicators of impairment to determine whether there is evidence\nof a loss in value. For an equity investment with impairment indicators, the fair value is measured based on discounted cash flows, or other appropriate valuation\nmethods, depending on the nature of the company involved. If it is probable that the carrying amount of the investment cannot be recovered, the impairment is\nconsidered other-than-temporary and recorded in earnings, and the equity investment balance is reduced to its fair value.\nAll equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method are measured at fair value with changes therein reflected in\nnet income. The Company utilizes the measurement alternative for equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values and measures these investments\nat cost less impairment, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions.

The costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the Company’s\nassumptions related to general economic conditions, particularly interest rates, expected return on plan assets, rate of compensation increase for employees and health\ncare cost trend rates. The cost of providing plan benefits depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover and plan participation.\nCosts for defined benefit pension plans consist of two elements: (1) on-going costs recognized quarterly, which are comprised of service and interest costs, expected\nreturn on plan assets and amortization of prior service costs; and (2) mark-to-market gains and losses outside of the corridor, where the corridor is equal to 10% of the\ngreater of the benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year, which are recognized annually in the fourth quarter of each year.\nThese gains and losses result from changes in actuarial assumptions and the differences between actual and expected return on plan assets. Any interim remeasurement,\ntriggered by a curtailment, settlement or significant plan change, as well as any true-up to the annual valuation, is recognized as a mark-to-market adjustment in the\nquarter in which such event occurs.\n \nCosts for postretirement benefit plans consist of on-going costs recognized quarterly, and are comprised of service and interest costs, amortization of prior service costs\nand amortization of actuarial gains and losses. Actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized as a component of accumulated\nother comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity on an annual basis and amortized into operating results over the average remaining service period of employees\nexpected to receive benefits under the plans, to the extent such gains and losses are outside the corridor.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax\nconsequences attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and for differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their\nrespective tax bases. Valuation allowances are established when management is unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred\ntax asset will ultimately be realized based upon the available evidence, including consideration of tax planning strategies.\nThe effective tax rate reflects the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits.

Certain\nassets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when impaired, which include long-lived assets, goodwill, equity method investments, other\ninvestments and asset retirement obligations.\nFair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset, or paid to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the principal, or most advantageous,\nmarket in which Corning would transact is analyzed. Assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer\nrestrictions and risk of non-performance, are considered.\nA three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon the observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs are based on market data\nor independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the Company’s own market assumptions. Once inputs have been characterized, the inputs are prioritized\ninto one of three broad levels used to measure fair value: Level 1, quoted market prices in active markets for identical instruments, Level 2, significant other observable\ninputs and Level 3, significant unobservable inputs.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company enters into a variety of foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates.  Financial exposure is managed in accordance with corporate policies and procedures.

Once the present value of projected benefit\npayments is calculated, the suggested discount rate is equal to the level rate that results in the same present value. The yield curve is based on actual high-quality\ncorporate bonds across the full maturity spectrum, which also includes private placements and eurobonds that are denominated in U.S. currency. The curve is developed\nfrom yields on hundreds of bonds from four grading sources, Moody’s, S&P, Fitch and the Dominion Bond Rating Service. A bond will be included if at least half of the\ngrades from these sources are Aa, non-callable bonds. The very highest 10% yields and the lowest 40% yields are excluded from the curve to eliminate outliers in the\nbond population.\nMortality is one of the key assumptions used in valuing liabilities of retirement plans. It is used to assign a probability of payment for benefits that are contingent upon\nparticipants’ survival. To make this assumption, benefit plan sponsors typically use a base mortality table and an improvement scale to mortality rates for future\nanticipated changes to historical death rates.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Corning updated the adjustment factors applied to its base mortality assumption (PRI-2012 white collar table and PRI-2012 blue collar table\nfor non-union and union participants, respectively) to value its U.S. benefit plan obligation, with no change in 2022. In addition, Corning also updated to the MP-2020\nprojection scale and the mortality assumption applied to disabled participants (PRI-2012 disabled mortality base table with future improvements using MP-2020) for the\nyear ended December 31, 2020, with no change in 2021 or 2022.  As the Society of Actuaries publishes additional mortality improvement scales and base mortality\ntables, Corning considers these revised schedules in setting its mortality assumptions.\nMeasurement of postretirement benefit expense is based on assumptions used to value the postretirement benefit obligation at the beginning of the year.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:\n \nPension benefits\n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \n \nDomestic\n   \nInternational\n   \nPostretirement benefits\n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \n2020\n   \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \n2020\n   \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \n2020\n \nDiscount rate\n   \n5.50%   \n2.87%   \n2.50%   \n2.46%   \n1.20%   \n1.02%   \n5.58%   \n2.99%   \n2.69%\nRate of compensation increase\n   \n3.48%   \n3.50%   \n4.16%   \n3.73%   \n3.63%   \n3.55%   \n      \n      \n  \nCash balance crediting rate\n   \n4.14%   \n3.86%   \n3.84%   \n0.82%   \n0.91%   \n0.94%   \n      \n      \n  \nEmployee contributions crediting rate\n   \n4.62%   \n1.57%   \n0.62%   \n      \n      \n      \n      \n      \n  \nThe following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit expense (income):\n \nPension benefits\n     \n \n     \n \n     \n \n \n \nDomestic\n   \nInternational\n   \nPostretirement benefits\n \n \n2022\n   \n2021\n   \n2020\n   \n2022\n   \n",

In the normal course of\nbusiness, the Company does not routinely provide significant third-party guarantees. Generally, third-party guarantees provided by Corning are limited to certain\nfinancial guarantees, including stand-by letters of credit and performance bonds, and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments\nrelated to attainment of milestones. These guarantees have various terms and none of these guarantees are individually significant. The Company believes a significant\nmajority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded.\nPurchase Commitments\nPurchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations. The Company has purchase commitments primarily for raw materials and energy-related take-or-\npay contracts.

Following the realignment, Corning no longer owned any interest in Dow Corning.\nWith the realignment, Corning agreed to indemnify Dow for 50% of Dow Corning’s non-ordinary course, pre-closing liabilities to the extent such liabilities exceed the\namounts reserved for them by Dow Corning as of May 31, 2016, subject to certain conditions and limits. Corning does not believe that its indemnity obligation will be\nmaterial.\nDow Corning Environmental Claims\nIn September 2019, Dow formally notified Corning of certain environmental matters for which Dow asserts that it has or will experience losses arising from remediation\nand response at a number of sites. In the event Dow is liable for these claims, Corning may be required to indemnify Dow for up to 50% of that liability, subject to\ncertain conditions and limits. As of December 31, 2022, Corning has determined a potential liability for these environmental matters is probable, and the amount\nreserved is not material. \nEnvironmental Litigation\nCorning has been designated by federal or state governments under environmental laws, including Superfund, as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for\ncleanup costs associated with 19 hazardous waste sites. It is Corning’s policy to accrue for its estimated liability related to such hazardous waste sites and other\nenvironmental liabilities related to property owned by Corning based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants. As of \nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, Corning had accrued approximately $109 million and $55 million, respectively, for the estimated undiscounted liability for environmental\ncleanup and related litigation.

These fluctuations affect the Company’s financial instruments and\ntransactions denominated in foreign currencies, which impact earnings.\nThe most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Japanese yen, South Korean won, new Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan, the euro and British pound. Corning\nseeks to mitigate the impact of exchange rate movements in the income statement by using over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivative instruments including foreign exchange\nforward and option contracts. In general, the expirations of these contracts coincide with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions.\nCorning is exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to these derivative contracts. However, this risk is minimized by maintaining a\nportfolio with a diverse group of highly-rated major financial institutions.

The gain or loss on the derivatives, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in current\nearnings. The amounts representing the time value component of the derivatives are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and amortized in earnings. The impact\nof the excluded component on Corning’s other comprehensive income and earnings is not material.

The carrying amount of the leased precious metals pool includes cumulative fair value losses of $95 million and $5 million as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCorning uses regression analysis or the critical term match method to assess initial hedge effectiveness. Following the inception of a hedging relationship, hedge\neffectiveness is assessed quarterly based on qualitative factors. \nUndesignated Hedges\nCorning uses OTC foreign exchange forward and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes to offset economic currency risks.

The emerging growth businesses primarily\nconsist of Pharmaceutical Technologies, Auto Glass Solutions and the Emerging Innovations Group.\nFinancial results for the reportable segments and Hemlock and Emerging Growth Businesses are prepared on a basis consistent with the internal disaggregation of\nfinancial information to assist the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in making internal operating decisions. As a significant portion of segment revenues and\nexpenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, management believes it is important to understand the impact on segment net sales and segment net\nincome of translating these currencies into U.S. dollars. Therefore, the Company utilizes constant-currency reporting for Display Technologies, Specialty Materials,\nEnvironmental Technologies and Life Sciences segments to exclude the impact on segment sales and segment net income (loss) from the Japanese yen, South Korean\nwon, Chinese yuan, new Taiwan dollar and the euro, as applicable to the segment. The most significant constant-currency adjustment relates to the Japanese yen\nexposure within the Display Technologies segment. Management utilizes constant-currency reporting based on internally-derived rates, as detailed below, which are\nclosely aligned with the currencies we have hedged. \nThe Company believes that the use of constant-currency reporting allows management to understand segment results without the volatility of currency fluctuation,\nanalyze underlying trends in the businesses and establish operational goals and forecasts. Further, it reflects the underlying economics of the translated earnings contracts\nused to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.\nConstant-currency rates are as follows and are applied to all periods presented:\nCurrency\n \nJapanese yen\n \nKorean won\n \nChinese yuan\n \nNew Taiwan dollar\n \nEuro\nRate\n \n¥107\n \n₩1,175\n \n¥6.7\n \nNT$31\n \n€.81\n101\n\n\nTable of Contents\n19.  Reportable S",

If there are conflicting answers:\n--> Use citations to select the correct answer if there are conflicting answers.\n\nBe brief and concise. No need for structured output - just think through the steps. You MUST respond in markdown format (for $ signs make sure to use escape character \\ before the $ sign).\n",
      "output": "From the collected outputs, we have gathered some information about Corning's effective tax rates for FY2021 and FY2022. Specifically, we have two key pieces of data:\n\n1. One output indicates the effective tax rate was 23% in FY2022 and 20% in FY2021.\n2. Another output provides slightly different figures: 22.9% for FY2022 and 20.2% for FY2021.\n\nBoth outputs are derived from financial statements, with citations indicating they were extracted from relevant sections of the document. The slight discrepancies in the figures could be due to rounding or different interpretations of the data.\n\nTo determine the change in the effective tax rate, we can calculate the difference between the rates for FY2022 and FY2021. Using the more precise figures from the second output (22.9% for FY2022 and 20.2% for FY2021), the change in the effective tax rate is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Change} = 22.9\\% - 20.2\\% = 2.7\\% \\]\n\nThis calculation shows that the effective tax rate increased by 2.7 percentage points from FY2021 to FY2022.\n\nThe information gathered is sufficient to answer the question, as we have consistent data from multiple outputs indicating the effective tax rates for the two fiscal years. There are no significant conflicts in the data that would prevent us from reaching a conclusion."
