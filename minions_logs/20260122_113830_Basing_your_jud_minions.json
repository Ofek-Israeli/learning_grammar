Total length: 702038 characters.: \n\n## Question\nBasing your judgments off of the balance sheet, what is the year end FY2018 amount of accounts payable for MGM Resorts? Answer in USD millions.\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 702038 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To answer the question about the year-end FY2018 amount of accounts payable for MGM Resorts, focus on locating the balance sheet section of the financial document. The balance sheet will provide a snapshot of the company's financial position at the end of the fiscal year, including liabilities such as accounts payable. Look specifically for the liabilities section, where accounts payable is typically listed. Ensure that you are examining the figures for the fiscal year 2018, as financial documents often include comparative data for multiple years. The amount should be clearly stated in USD millions, which is the required format for your answer."

Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets\nin which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete\nto a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and\ninternationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business.” We\nface significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, and failure to\ncompete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”\n \nOur primary methods of successful competition include:\n \n•\nLocating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;\n \n•\nConstructing  and  maintaining  high-quality  resorts  and  facilities,  including  luxurious  guestrooms,  state-of-the-art  convention  facilities  and  premier\ndining, entertainment, retail and other amenities",

We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and\nvalue-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during\nmid-week and off-peak periods.\n \nOur Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or\nnear the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos\nelsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently\nexpanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las\nVegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.\n \nOutside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where\nlocation is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.\n \nMGM China\n \nThe three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP casino gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations.\nVIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who offer VIP\nplayers  various  services,  such  as extension  of credit  as  well  as  complimentary  hotel,  food  and  beverage  services.  Gaming  promoters  are  compensated  through\npayment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover-based commissions.

Through three primary channels – our employee-\ndriven MGM Resorts Foundation, our Employee Volunteer Program and our Corporate Giving Program, we contribute leadership, funding and manpower to an\nextensive  array  of  nonprofit  organizations  that  provide  services,  goods  and  resources  indispensable  to  our  communities’  well-being,  development  and\nstability.

Many  major  travel  service  providers  recognize  the  Green  Key designation  and\nidentify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations. \n \nIn  addition,  we  believe  that  incorporating  the  tenets  of  environmental  sustainability  in  our  business  decisions  advances  a  platform  for  innovation  and\noperational efficiency.

The\nhotel, resort and casino industries are highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel,\nresort and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room\ncapacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also\nexpand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the\ndomestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas,\nincluding California, has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. While we believe our principal competitors are\nmajor gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peer\ninventory sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners. We expect that we will continue to face\nincreased competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel\nindustry that could impact our ability to attract and retain business.\n \nIn  addition,  competition  could  increase  if  changes  in  gaming  restrictions  in  the  United  States  and elsewhere  result  in  the  addition  of new  gaming\nestablishments located closer to our customers than our casinos.

Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including Nevada and New Jersey, have also\nlegalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions, including Illinois, have legalized video gaming terminals. Additionally, in May 2018, the\nUnited States Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting that had prohibited single-game gambling in most states, raising the potential\nfor increased competition in sports betting should additional states pass legislation to legalize it.  The expansion of online gaming, sports betting, and\nother types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino\nresorts.\n \nIn addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we\noperate.

In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign\nunconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The\nregulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results\nof operations. For example, recently the U.S. Department of Justice reversed a 2011 opinion that had concluded that the Wire Act of 1961 was limited\nto gaming relating to sports; the Department of Justice concluded instead that certain of the Wire Act’s provisions apply also to other forms of wagering\nactivity.

In addition, changes in\ndiscretionary  consumer spending or consumer preferences  could be driven by factors such as the increased  cost of travel,  an unstable  job market,\nperceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other acts of\nviolence. Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in\nrecent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and\ntimely react to\n14\n\n\n \n \nthese trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations.

A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to\ncause a reduction i n visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect our operating results. For example, the prior recession and downturn in\nconsumer and corporate spending had a negative impact on our results of operations.\n \nIn addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai from mainland China, general economic and\nmarket conditions in China could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on travel\nand currency conversion or movements, including market impacts resulting from China’s recent anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of\nliquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and\nother ATM limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government), could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland China and/or the\namounts they are willing to spend in the casino. Most recently, in July 2017, the Chinese government, along with Macau authorities, implemented new\nfacial  recognition  technology  on  ATM  machines  in  Macau  to  strictly  enforce  the  “know  you r customer”  regulations  for  mainland  Chinese  bank\ncardholders and in November 2017 new rules were adopted to control the cross-border transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments. It is\nunclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have\nhad, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland\nChina, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.\nFurthermore, our operations in Macau ",

MGM expects to acquire\nthese operations in the first half of 2019, subject to certain customary closing conditions.  The Ohio operation has employees covered by collective\nbargaining agreements, several of which we anticipate will be negotiated in 2019. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest,\nstrikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations. Further, adverse\npublicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage\nand/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

Additional lawsuits related to this incident may be filed in the future. In\nFebruary of 2019, we and plaintiffs’ counsel commenced mediation of these matters.  The above-described litigation currently is stayed pending mediation .\n \nWe are currently unable to reliably predict the future developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of pending or future litigation\nrelated to this matter.

The foregoing determination was made in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability on the part of us or any of our affiliates. Given that\nthese cases are in the early stages and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of\nreasonably possible liability.

The insurance carriers have not expressed a reservation of rights or coverage defense that affects our evaluation of potential losses in connection\nwith these claims. In addition, our general liability insurance coverage provides, as part of the contractual “duty to defend”, payment of legal fees and associated\ncosts incurred to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas.

Our effective tax rate in 2017 was favorably impacted by a non-recurring, non-cash income tax\nbenefit of $1.4 billion resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities required due to the enactment of the Tax Act, partially offset by the\naccrual of the Macau shareholder dividend tax. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was favorably impacted by income tax benefits attributable to a decrease in valuation\nallowance on foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryovers and permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on the Borgata transaction, partially offset by income tax\nexpense attributable to the remeasurement of Macau deferred tax liabilities resulting from a change in assumption concerning renewal of the exemption from the\nMacau complementary tax on gaming profits.\n \nCash taxes paid decreased in 2018 primarily due to the impact of the Tax Act changes, most notably the increase in the recapture of overall domestic losses\nfrom 50 percent of U.S. taxable income to 100 percent of U.S. taxable income, resulting in increased FTC carryover usage.  Cash taxes paid increased in 2017\ncompared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in federal income taxes paid resulting from increased U.S. taxable income and state income taxes attributable to\nBorgata, which has been consolidated since the August 2016 acquisition of Boyd Gaming’s interest in the company.\n \nNon-GAAP Measures\n \n“Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up\nexpenses, NV Energy exit expense, gain on Borgata transaction, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate\nexpense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each property. “Adjusted Property EBITDA margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDA divided by\nnet revenues.

Cash provided by\noperating activities was $1.7 billion in 2018 compared to $2.2 billion in 2017. Operating cash flows decreased in the current period primarily due to the change in\nworking capital related to timing of significant purchases of chips by gaming promoters at MGM China, as well as a decrease in consolidated operating income, and\nan increase in cash paid for interest.

We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances\ntimely.  These  collection  efforts  are  similar  to  those  used  by  most  large  corporations  when  dealing  with  overdue  customer  accounts,  including  the  mailing  of\nstatements  and  delinquency  notices,  personal  contacts,  the  use  of  outside  collection  agencies  and  civil  litigation.

Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign\ncustomers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when\nwe issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates the credit\nworthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of the Company’s casino receivables and those\ndue from customers residing in foreign countries.\n \nWe maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating\nexpense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is\nnot significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. At domestic resorts where marker play is\nsignificant, we apply standard reserve percentages  to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability  of each\naccount with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known\ninformation. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial\ncondition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.\n47\n\n\n \n \nIn addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors,\nincluding changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries.

A  significant  amount  of  our  property  and  equipment  was  acquired  through  business  combinations  and  was\ntherefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its\nlife are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we\nconstruct  assets,  we  capitalize  direct  costs  of  the  project,  including  fees  paid  to  architects  and  contractors,  property  taxes,  and  certain  costs  of  our  design  and\nconstruction subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project.\nInterest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts\nwhen construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.\n \nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a\ncapital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired,\nwhich also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful\nlives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever\nevents or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\n \nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\n \nWe evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used.\nSeveral criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset\nat a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying\nvalue or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model.

We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted\nbasis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not\nexceed  the  carrying  value,  then  an  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset.  For  operating  assets,  fair  value  is  typically  measured  using  a\ndiscounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing\nmodel, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized\nimpairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.\n \n48\n\n\n \nThere are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the\nasset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level\nfor which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the g rouping of assets. Future cash\nflow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.\n \nOn a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment.\nPotential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic\nfactors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets\nand probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential\nsale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.\n \nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment test\nfor indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. For\nour 2018 and 2017 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative (“step zero”) analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and\nconcluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin.

The estimated fair values of the intangibles were substantially in excess of their carrying\nvalues, with the fair value of the Borgata trade name exceeding its carrying value by approximately 2%, reflecting the recentness of the Borgata acquisition which\noccurred in August 2016. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses.

Market risk is the risk of loss arising\nfrom adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk\nassociated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings\nand short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the Operating\nPartnership’s  term  loan  B  facility.  A  change  in  interest  rates  generally  does  not  have  an  impact  upon  our  future  earnings  and  cash  flow  for  fixed-rate  debt\ninstruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by\nchanges in interest rates.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of\ninternal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\n \nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting\nand the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial  statements  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures  of  the  company  are  being  made  only  in\naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n \nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with\nthe policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n \n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n \nLas Vegas, Nevada  \n \nFebruary 27, 2019\n \n \n53\n\n\n \nR EPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n \nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of MGM Resorts International\n \nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2018\nand 2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period\nended December 31, 2018, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2), (collectively\nreferred to as the \"financial statements\").

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable\nassurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to\nassess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

For  entities  not  determined  to  be  a  variable  interest  entity  (“VIE”),  the  Company  consolidates  such  entities  in  which  the\nCompany owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity if it has the\ndirect or indirect ability to control the entities’ activities based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements. For these entities, the Company\nrecords a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50% or less owned are\naccounted  for  under  the  equity  method  when  the  Company  can  exercise  significant  influence  over  or  has  joint  control  of  the  unconsolidated  affiliate.  All\nintercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. A\nVIE is an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the ac",

The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power\nto direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the\nVIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. For\nthese VIEs, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon\nsubsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the\ndisposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.\nManagement has determined that MGP is a VIE because the Class A equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the\nactivities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGP\nand consolidates MGP because (i) its ownership of MGP’s single Class B share entitles it to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) the\nexchangeable nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the Company the right to receive benefits from MGP that could potentially be significant to\nMGP.

The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:\n \n \n•\nLevel 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9;\n \n•\nLevel 2 and Level 3 inputs  when assessing the fair value of assets acquired  and liabilities  assumed  during the Northfield  transaction  and Borgata\ntransaction. See Note 4.\n \nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of\nacquisition.  Such  investments  are  carried  at  cost,  which  approximates  market  value.  Book  overdraft  balances  resulting  from  the  Company’s  cash  management\nprogram are recorded as accounts payable or construction payable as applicable.\n \nAccounts receivable and credit risk. Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino\naccounts  receivable.  The  Company  issues  credit  to  approved  casino  customers  and  gaming  promoters  following  background  checks  and  investigations  of\ncreditworthiness. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, approximately 62% and 40%, respectively, of our gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from\nforeign countries, primarily Asia. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.\n \nAccounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be\nuncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the\nCompany’s  receivables  to  their  net  carrying  amount,  which  approximates  fair  value.  The  allowance  is  estimated  based  on  both  a  specific  review  of  customer\naccounts  as  well  as  historical  collection  experience  and  current  economic  and  business  conditions.  Management  believes  that  as  of  December  31,  2018,  no\nsignificant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.\n \nInventories. Inventories  consist  primarily  of  food  and  beverage,  retail  merchandise  and  operating  supplies,  and  are  stated  at  the  lower  of  cost  or  net\nrealizable value",

Cost for retail merchandise is determined\nusing the cost method.\n \nProperty and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired through\nbusiness combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the\ndetermination of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had accrued $47 million and $28\nmillion, respectively for property and equipment within accounts payable, and $2 million and $34 million, respectively, related to construction retention within other\nlong-term liabilities.\n \nProperty and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:\n \nBuildings and improvements\n \n15 to 40 years\nLand improvements\n \n10 to 20 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n \n3 to 20 years\nEquipment\n \n3 to 15 years\n \nThe Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and\nused. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the\nasset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower of\ncarrying value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be\nheld and\n62\n\n\n \nused, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an\nundiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash\nflows do not exceed the carr ying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow\nmodel. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized im pairment losses, whether for assets held for\nsale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.\n \nCapitalized interest. The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project.\nWhen no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s\noutstanding borrowings.

The  Company  has  investments  in  unconsolidated  affiliates  accounted  for  under  the  equity\nmethod. Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences,\nas well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investment\nand recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well as\ngains and impairments related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of operating income or loss and classifies non-operating income or\nlosses related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of non-operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in such unconsolidated\naffiliates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations.\n \nThe Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying\nvalue of its investment may have experienced an “other-than-temporary” decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value of\nthe  investment to  its  carrying value  to  determine  if  an  impairment  is  indicated  and  determines whether the  impairment  is  “other-than-temporary” based  on  its\nassessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a\ndiscounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that\nutilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. See Note 6 for results of the Company’s review of its\ninvestment in certain of its unconsolidated affiliates.\n \nGoodwill  and  other  intangible  assets. Goodwill  represents  the  excess  of  purchase  price  over  fair  market  value  of  net  assets  acquired  in  business\ncombinations.  Goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  must  be  reviewed  for  impairment  at  least  annually  and  between  annual  test  dates  in  certain\ncircumstances.

No impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of\nthe annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2018, 2017 and 2016.\n \nAccounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly referred to\nas “step zero”) in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary.

In addition, the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value\ndetermined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero\nanalysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a quantitative analysis.\n \nUnder the quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated\nfuture results of the Company’s reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market\napproach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company\nadopted accounting guidance that simplifies goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly\n“Step 2”) in the event that impairment is identified. Instead, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the reporting\nunit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Under the quantitative analysis, license rights are tested for impairment\nusing  a  discounted cash  flow  approach,  and  trademarks  are  tested  for  impairment  using  the  relief-from-royalty  method.  If  the  fair  value  of  an  indefinite-lived\nintangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.\n \nRevenue recognition.

SAB 118\nprovides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740.\nIn accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete.

However,  the  Company  was  able  to  make\nreasonable estimates of certain effects and, therefore, recorded a provisional discrete non-cash net tax benefit of $1.4 billion in the period ended December 31, 2017,\nconsisting of a benefit of $988 million for the corporate rate reduction and a benefit of $438 million from its provisional re-assessment of the Tax Act’s impact on\nthe valuation allowance on its foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryovers. The Company did not provide tax expense for the transition tax on its unrepatriated earnings,\nwhich totaled $669 million without regard to actual 2017 distributions of $62 million, because such earnings were fully offset by FTCs.\n \nThe Company’s accounting for the impact of the Tax Act is now complete. The Company recorded non-cash income tax expense totaling $20 million during\nthe measurement period in 2018, as it adjusted its valuation allowance on its FTC carryovers to account for guidance clarifying the treatment of FTCs resulting from\nGILTI and other provisions impacting FTC utilization. These measurement period adjustments increased the Company’s effective tax rate by 3% during the year\nended December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company finalized its accounting for the tax treatment of indirect costs of providing certain employee fringe benefits\nsubject to limitation under the Tax Act. This measurement period adjustment had an immaterial impact on the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31,\n2018.\n \nThe Company has made an accounting policy decision to treat taxes due, if any, on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income under the GILTI provisions as a\ncurrent period expense when incurred. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a deferred tax liability for any GILTI taxes that may result in future periods.\n \nThe Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $2.4 billion on its FTC carryover of $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2018, resulting in an FTC net\ndeferred tax asset of $481 million. The FTCs are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is 35% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because MGM\nGrand Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming\nTax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable  against U.S. taxes.

The Company relies on future U.S. source operating income in assessing utilization of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTC\nrealization during the 10-year FTC carryover period.

As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible\nneed for a valuation allowance and changes to such assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the\nprovision for income taxes in the period including such change.  \n \nIncome generated from gaming operations of MGM Grand Paradise is exempted from Macau’s 12% complementary tax, pursuant to approval from the\nMacau government.

However, MGM Grand Paradise has had an agreement with the Macau government to settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its\nshareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment (“annual fee arrangement”) regardless of the amount of distributable\ndividends.

CityCenter Holdings, LLC (the “Company”) is a Delaware limited liability company that owns and operates CityCenter in Las Vegas, Nevada\n(“CityCenter”). The Company is a joint venture which is 50%-owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of MGM Resorts International (together with its subsidiaries,\n“MGM Resorts”), a Delaware corporation, and 50%-owned by Infinity World Development Corp (“Infinity World”), which is wholly owned by Dubai World, a\nDubai United Arab Emirates government decree entity (each, a “Member”). The governing document for the Company is the Third Amended and Restated Limited\nLiability Company Agreement dated December 22, 2015 (the “LLC Agreement”).\n \nUnder the LLC Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company is composed of six representatives (subject to intermittent vacancies) – three selected by\neach Member – and has exclusive power and authority for the overall management of the Company. Compensation for Board of Directors’ duties is borne by the\nMembers. The Company has no employees and has entered into several agreements with MGM Resorts to provide day-to-day management of CityCenter and the\nCompany. See Note 10 for further discussion of such agreements.\n \nNature of Business. CityCenter is a mixed-use development on the Las Vegas Strip located between the Bellagio and Park MGM (which was branded as\nMonte Carlo prior to May 2018) resorts, both owned by MGM Resorts. CityCenter consists of the following components:\n \n \n•\nAria  Resort  &  Casino,  a  4,004-room  casino  resort  featuring  an  approximately  140,000  square-foot  casino,  approximately  500,000  square  feet  of\nconference and convention space, and numerous world-class restaurants, nightclub and bars, and pool and spa amenities",

See Note 3 for additional information related to the\nsale.\n \nIn April 2016, the Company closed the sale of The Shops at Crystals (“Crystals”). See Note 3 for additional information related to the sale.\n \n \nNOTE 2 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n \nBasis of presentation. The consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  Company and  its  subsidiaries.  The  Company  does  not  have  a\nvariable interest in any variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations are not\nnecessarily indicative of the results to be expected in the future.\n \nManagement’s use of estimates. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America. Those principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\nliabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \nFair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting for and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets and intangible\nassets. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at\nthe measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy consisting of: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are\nobservable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used Level 2 inputs when measuring the fair value of its interest\nrate swaps. The interest rate swap values are recorded as a net unrealized gain or loss position and recognized as an asset or liability within “Other assets” or “Other\nlong-term obligations.” See Note 7.\n \n5\n\n\nExhibit 99.3\n \nCash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of ninety days or less at the date\nof acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n \nAccounts  receivable  and  credit  risk. The  Company  issues  markers  to  approved  casino  customers  following  investigations  of  creditworthiness.  As  of\nDecember 31, 2018, approximately 53% of the Company’s casino receivables were due fr",

Enforceability issues, business or\neconomic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.\n \nTrade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when\nmanagement deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An allowance for doubtful accounts is\nmaintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their estimated realizable amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on a specific\nreview of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31,\n2018, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed.\n \nInventories. Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost\nis determined primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method.\n \nResidential  real  estate. Residential  real  estate  represented  capitalized  costs  of  residential  inventory,  which  consisted  of  completed  condominium  units\navailable for sale less impairments previously recognized. Costs included land, direct and indirect construction and development costs, and capitalized property taxes\nand interest. The last residential units were sold in 2016.\n \nProperty and equipment. Property and equipment are stated at cost including capitalized interest. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment\nare included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life\nare charged to expense as incurred. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had accrued $2.9 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for property and\nequipment within accounts payable, and $0.3 million and $3.5 million, respectively, related to construction retention within accounts payable.\n \nProperty and equipment are depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:\n \nBuildings and improvements\n \n20 to 40 years\nLand improvements\n \n10 to 20 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n \n3 to 20 years\nEquipment\n \n3 to 15 years\n \nProject costs are stated at cost and recorded as property and equipment (which includes adjustments made upon the initial contribution by MGM Resorts to\nthe extent such property or equipment is contributed by MGM Resorts) unless determined to be impaired, in which case the carrying value is reduced to estimated\nfair value.\n \nIn December 2015, the Company decided to close the Zarkana show at the Aria Resort & Casino as part of a plan to expand its conference and convention\n",

The fully depreciated assets related to the Zarkana theatre were disposed in April 2016 and construction of the conference\nand expansion space began in May 2016, which opened during the first quarter of 2018.\n \nCapitalized interest.   The interest costs associated with development  and construction projects are capitalized  and included in the cost of the project.\nCapitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.\n \nImpairment of long-lived assets. The Company evaluates its property and equipment for impairment as held and used. The Company reviews assets to be\nheld and used for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. It then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the\ncarrying amount of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the\ncarrying  amount,  then  impairment  is  recorded  based  on  the  fair  value  of  the  asset,  typically  measured  using  a  discounted  cash  flow  model.  Any  recognized\nimpairment losses would be recorded as operating expense.\n \n6\n\n\nExhibit 99.3\n \nOther assets. The Company’s other assets include intangible assets, deposits, base stock, and other assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for\nimpairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible\nassets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year . No impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review.\n \nDebt issuance costs . The Company capitalizes debt issuance costs, which include legal and other direct costs related to the issuance of debt. The capitalized\ncosts are amortized straight-line to interest expense over the contractual term of the debt.\n \nRevenue  recognition. The  Company’s  revenue  contracts  with  customers  consist  of  casino  wager  transactions,  hotel  room  sales,  food  and  beverage\ntransactions, entertainment shows, and retail transactions.\n \nThe  transaction  price  for  a  casino  wager  is  the  difference  between  gaming  wins  and  losses  (“net  win”).  In  certain  circumstances,  the  Company  offers\ndiscounts on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. The Company accounts for casino\nrevenue on a portfolio basis given the similar characteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis.\n \nFor casino wager transactions that include other goods and services provided by the Company to gaming pa",

This allocation is deferred and recognized as revenue when the customer redeems the incentive.\nWhen redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third party outlets are deducted\nfrom the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue. Commissions and incentives provided\nto gaming customers were collectively $212 million, $190 million and $194 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. After\nallocating revenue to other goods and services provided as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue.\n \nThe transaction price of rooms, food and beverage, and retail contracts is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. The\ntransaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue when the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery is\nmade for the food and beverage and retail and other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. For some arrangements, the Company acts\nas an agent in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services, which primarily include certain of the Company’s entertainment shows as well as\ncustomer rooms arranged by online travel agents.\n \nThe Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings with\nhotel  stays  and  convention  services.  For  such  arrangements,  the  Company  allocates  revenue  to  each  good  or  service  based  on  its  relative  SSP.  The  Company\nprimarily determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when sold\nseparately in similar circumstances to similar customers.\n \nContract and Contract-Related Liabilities. There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue,\nresulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip\nliability, which represents the amounts owned in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligati",

During 2017, the terms of the\nongoing impact  fee obligations  were modified.  Such modifications  included a credit  to be applied against  future  non-bypassable  rate charges  and substantially\nshortened the period over which MGM Resorts, including the Company, is responsible for such charges, with an end date in 2022. As such, the Company recognized\na reduction in its liability for future charges of $8 million with a corresponding credit to “NV Energy exit expense.” As of December 31, 2018, and 2017, the\nCompany recorded an estimate of such liability on a discounted basis of $1 million and $2 million, respectively, in “Due to MGM Resorts International” and $2\nmillion and $4 million, respectively, in “Other long-term obligations.”\n \nOther  litigation.
