Total length: 306025 characters.: \n\n## Question\nWhat are major acquisitions that Best Buy has done in FY2023, FY2022 and FY2021?\n\n---\n\nPlease provide succinct advice on the critical information we need to extract from the Financial document. Total length: 306025 characters to answer this question. \n\nAlso consider the following constraints:\n- In your response do NOT use numbered lists.\n- Do NOT structure your response as a sequence of steps.\n",
      "output": "To address the question about Best Buy's major acquisitions in FY2023, FY2022, and FY2021, focus on identifying sections of the financial document that discuss mergers and acquisitions. Look for headings or subheadings related to \"Acquisitions,\" \"Business Combinations,\" or \"Strategic Investments.\" Pay attention to any tables or summaries that list transactions, as these often provide concise details about the acquisitions, including the names of acquired companies, the nature of the acquisition, and the financial impact. Additionally, review the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section, as it may provide context and strategic rationale behind these acquisitions. Ensure that you extract information specifically related to the fiscal years in question to maintain relevance."

      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

Both segments operate an omnichannel \nplatform that allows customers to come to us online, visit our stores or invite us into their homes.\nDevelopment of merchandise and service offerings, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, online and mobile application operations, marketing \nand advertising and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed. In addition, support capabilities (for example, human resources, finance, \ninformation technology and real estate management) operate from our corporate headquarters.

Our ship-from-store \ncapability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution \ncenters.\nSuppliers and Inventory\nOur Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2023, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately \n79% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, HP, LG and Sony – representing approximately 57% of total merchandise \npurchased. We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise or that \nsecure any of the key terms of our arrangements.\nWe carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels in an effort to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to \nour inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt \nlevels and pricing, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives, and agreements with vendors relating to \nreturn privileges for certain products.\nWe also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our exclusive brands products.\nStore Development\nWe had 1,138 stores at the end of fiscal 2023 throughout our Domestic and International segments. Our stores are a vital component of our omnichannel \nstrategy, and we believe they are an important competitive advantage. We also have vendor store-within-a-store concepts to allow closer vendor partnerships \nand a higher quality customer experience.

We continue to reduce our carbon emissions and \nplan to achieve this goal by investing in energy efficiency improvements, deploying small-scale onsite and utility-scale renewable energy systems, \nelectrifying our fleet and neutralizing residual emissions.\n\nReduce water consumption 15% by 2025 (over a 2019 baseline). By monitoring our water consumption across our business, and identifying actions that \nlessen our dependence on water, we continue to reduce our water usage. \n\nAchieve zero-waste certification at additional distribution center locations. To continue reducing our impact on the environment, we are working toward \nbuilding a more sustainable supply chain and expanding our Total Resource Use and Efficiency zero-waste certification efforts across our warehousing \noperations.\nWe aim to help our customers reduce their impact on the environment as well. Through the sale of ENERGY STAR® products, we expect to help our customers \nreduce carbon emissions 20% by 2030 (over a 2017 baseline), which we estimate will save our customers collectively at least $5 billion on utility bills.\nWe support the circular economy by keeping consumer products in use for as long as possible through our repair and trade-in services.

In addition to general levels of inflation, we are also subject to risks of specific inflationary pressures on product prices due \nto, for example, high consumer demand, component shortages and supply chain disruption. We may be unable to increase our prices sufficiently to offset these \npressures.\nGeopolitical issues around the world and how our markets are positioned can also impact macroeconomic conditions and could have a material adverse impact \non our financial results.

We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise. Our \nprofitability depends on securing acceptable terms with our vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them, funding for \nvarious forms of promotional programs, payment terms, allocations of merchandise, development of compelling assortments of products, operation of vendor-\nfocused shopping experiences within our stores and terms covering returns and factory warranties.

The \npotential adverse impact of these factors can be amplified by price transparency (which can limit our flexibility to modify selling prices) and a highly competitive \nretail environment. Generally, our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our vendors is more difficult with vendors where our purchases represent a smaller \nproportion of their total revenues and/or when there is less competition for those products. In addition, vendors may decide to limit or cease allowing us to offer \ncertain categories, focus their marketing efforts on alternative channels or make unfavorable changes to our financial or other terms.\nWe are also dependent on a relatively small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections. The competitive strategies \nutilized by mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business, especially with ongoing consolidation in the mobile industry.

In addition, our carriers may also serve \ncustomers through their own stores, websites, mobile applications and call centers or through other competing retail channels.\nDemand for the products and services we sell could decline if we fail to maintain positive brand perception and recognition through a focus on \nconsumer experience.\nWe operate a portfolio of brands with a commitment to customer service and innovation.

Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are \ndiscussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in \nItem 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \nCondition and Results of Operations, in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2022, for discussion of the results of operations for the year ended \nJanuary 29, 2022, compared to the year ended January 30, 2021, which is incorporated by reference herein.\nOverview\nWe are driven by our purpose to enrich lives through technology and our vision to personalize and humanize technology solutions for every stage of life. We \naccomplish this by leveraging our combination of technology and a human touch to meet our customers’ everyday needs, whether they come to us online, visit \nour stores or invite us into their homes. We have operations in the U.S. and Canada.\nWe have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of our operations in all states, districts and territories of the \nU.S. and our Best Buy Health business, and includes the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Ads, Best Buy Business, Best Buy Health, CST, Current Health, Geek \nSquad, Lively, Magnolia, Pacific Kitchen and Home, TechLiquidators and Yardbird and the domain names bestbuy.com, currenthealth.com, lively.com, \ntechliquidators.com and yardbird.com. The International segment is comprised of all operations in Canada under the brand names Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile \nand Geek Squad and the domain name bestbuy.ca.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest the end of January. Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included 52 weeks. Our business, like that of many \nretailers, is seasonal. A large proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping \nseason.\nComparable Sales\nThroughout this MD&A, we refer to comparable sales. Comparable sales is a metric used by management to evaluate the performance of our existing stores, \nwebsites and call centers by measuring the change in net sales for a particular period over the comparable prior-period of equivalent length. Comparable sales \nincludes revenue from stores, websites and call centers operating for at least 14 full months. Revenue from online sales is included in comparable sales and \nrepresents sales initiated on a website or app, regardless of whether customers choose to pick up product in store, curbside, at an alternative pick-up location or \ntake delivery direct to their homes. Revenue from acquisitions is included in comparable sales beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniv",

Comparable sales also includes credit card revenue, gift card breakage, commercial sales and sales of merchandise to wholesalers \nand dealers, as applicable. Revenue from stores closed more than 14 days, including but not limited to relocated, remodeled, expanded and downsized stores, or \nstores impacted by natural disasters, is excluded from comparable sales until at least 14 full months after reopening. Comparable sales excludes the impact of \nrevenue from discontinued operations, the impact of profit-share revenue from our services plan portfolio and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency \nexchange rates (applicable to our International segment only). All periods presented apply this methodology consistently.\nOn November 2, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (“Current Health”). On November 4, 2021, we acquired all outstanding shares of \nTwo Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (“Yardbird”). Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of Current Health and Yardbird are excluded from \nour comparable sales calculation until the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\nWe believe comparable sales is a meaningful supplemental metric for investors to evaluate revenue performance resulting from growth in existing stores, \nwebsites and call centers versus the portion resulting from opening new stores or closing existing stores. The method of calculating comparable sales varies \nacross the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), as well as certain adjusted \nor non-GAAP financial measures, such as constant currency, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per \nshare (“EPS”). We believe that non-GAAP financial measures, when reviewed in conjunction with GAAP financial measures, provide additional useful information \nfor evaluating current period performance and assessing future performance. For these reasons, internal management reporting, including budgets, forecasts \nand financial targets used for short-term incentives are based on non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, our non-GAAP financial measures include \nadjustments for items such as restructuring charges, goodwill and intangible asset impairments, price-fixing settlements, gains and losses on certain investments, \nintangible asset amortization, certain acquisition-related costs and the tax effect of all such items. In addition, certain other items may be excluded from non-\nGAAP financial measures when we believe doing so provides greater clarity to management and our investors.

These non-GAAP \nfinancial measures should be considered in addition to, and not superior to or as a substitute for, GAAP financial measures. We strongly encourage investors and \nshareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Non-GAAP financial \nmeasures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies, thereby limiting their usefulness for comparative purposes.\n23\n\n\nIn our discussions of the operating results of our consolidated business and our International segment, we sometimes refer to the impact of changes in foreign \ncurrency exchange rates or the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are references to the differences between the foreign currency \nexchange rates we use to convert the International segment’s operating results from local currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. We also may use \nthe term “constant currency,” which represents results adjusted to exclude foreign currency impacts. We calculate those impacts as the difference between the \ncurrent period results translated using the current period currency exchange rates and using the comparable prior period currency exchange rates. We believe \nthe disclosure of revenue changes in constant currency provides useful supplementary information to investors in light of significant fluctuations in currency rates.\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section below for detailed reconciliations of items impacting non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP effective tax \nrate and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the presented periods.\nBusiness Strategy Update\nDuring fiscal 2023, our team delivered strong execution and relentless focus on customer service during what continues to be a challenging environment for our \nindustry. Throughout the fiscal year, we remained committed to balancing our near-term response to current conditions and managing well what is in our control, \nwhile also advancing our strategic initiatives and investing in areas important for our long-term performance.\nDuring the first year of the pandemic, we said we believed customer shopping behavior would be permanently changed in a way that is even more digital and \nputs customers entirely in control to shop how they want. And our strategy was to embrace that reality, and to lead not follow. \nIn fiscal 2023, digital sales comprised 33% of our Domestic revenue compared to 19% in fiscal 2020. Sales via phone, chat and virtual have also remained \nsignificantly higher. Even with that shift, our stores remain a cornerstone of our differentiation.

Therefore, we are focused on evolving our omnichannel retail strategy over time, including our portfolio of stores, operating \nmodel and digital tools, to provide customers with differentiated experiences and enhance our omnichannel fulfillment. \nWe continue to advance our other strategic initiatives as well. We are building customer relationships through membership, including evolving our free My Best \nBuy program and our paid Best Buy Totaltech membership option. In Best Buy Health, we are essentially nurturing a startup within a large-scale organization and \nleveraging Best Buy’s core assets, including the Geek Squad, to grow, build and establish the Care at Home space, an emerging part of the healthcare industry. \nAs we enter fiscal 2024, macroeconomic headwinds will likely result in continued pressure, and we are preparing for sales in the consumer electronics industry to \ndecline again this year. In particular, our customers are facing economic challenges from the dual pressures of high inflation and the resulting interest rate \nincreases, and it is difficult to predict how such factors will impact us in the near term. However, we expect several factors to drive the eventual return of industry \ngrowth over time, including the natural upgrade and replacement cycles for the technology bought earlier in the pandemic and continued vendor innovation. In \naddition, macro technology trends like cloud, augmented reality and expanded broadband access have the potential to drive new products and demand. While \nour product categories tend to experience slightly different timing nuances, in general, we believe they are poised for growth in the coming years. In addition, we \nare continuing our expansion into newer categories like wellness technology, personal electric transportation, outdoor living and electric car charging.\nWe remain excited about our industry and our future. There are more technology products than ever in people’s homes, technology is increasingly a necessity in \nour lives, and we believe we are uniquely there for our customers as they continue to navigate this innovative space. \n24\n\n\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nSelected consolidated financial data was as follows ($ in millions, except per share amounts):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConsolidated Performance Summary\n2023\n \n2022\n \n2021\nRevenue\n$\n 46,298  \n \n$\n 51,761  \n \n$\n 47,262  \nRevenue % change\n \n (10.6)%  \n \n 9.5 %  \n \n 8.3 %\nComparable sales % change\n \n (9.9)%  \n \n 10.4 %  \n \n 9.7 %\nGross profit\n$\n 9,912  \n \n$\n 11,640  \n \n$\n 10,573  \nGross profit as a % of revenue(1)\n \n 21.4 %  \n \n 22.5 %  \n \n 22.4 %\nSG&A\n$\n 7,970  \n \n$\n 8,635  \n \n$\n 7,928  \nSG&A as a % of revenue(1)\n \n 17.2 %  \n \n 16.7 %",

We have not made any material changes to our \naccounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully \nunderstanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments and generally \nincorporate significant uncertainty.\nVendor Allowances\nDescription\nWe receive funds from our merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, primarily in the form of purchases-based or sales-based \nvolumes and for product advertising and placement. We recognize allowances based on purchases and sales as a reduction of cost of sales when the associated \ninventory is sold. Allowances for advertising and placement are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales ratably over the corresponding performance period. \nFunds that are determined to be a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell a vendor's products are recorded as an offset to \nthe related expense within SG&A when incurred.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nDue to the quantity and diverse nature of our vendor agreements, estimates are made to determine the amount of funding to be recognized in earnings or \ndeferred as an offset to inventory. These estimates require a detailed analysis of complex factors, including (1) proper classification of the type of funding \nreceived; and (2) the methodology to estimate the portion of purchases-based funding that should be recognized in cost of sales in each period, which considers \nfactors such as inventory turn by product category and actual sell-through of inventory.\n31\n\n\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in our vendor funding deferral as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $45 million in fiscal 2023. The level of \nvendor funding deferral has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\nGoodwill\nDescription\nGoodwill is evaluated for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be \nrecoverable. The impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value. Fair value reflects our estimate of the price \na potential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction. \nWe have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic (comprising our core U.S. Best Buy business) and Best Buy Health – with carrying values of $492 \nmillion and $891 million, respectively, as of January 28, 2023.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit requires complex analysis and judgment. We use a combination of discounted cash flow (“DCF”) models and market \ndata, such as earnings",

DCF models require detailed forecasts of cash flow drivers, \nsuch as revenue growth rates, margin rates and capital investments, and estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. These estimates incorporate many \nuncertain factors, such as the effectiveness of our strategy, changes in customer behavior, technological changes, competitor actions, regulatory changes and \nmacroeconomic trends.\nEffects if actual results differ from assumptions\nFor our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, fair value exceeded book value by a substantial margin in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Compared to fiscal 2022, the \nexcess of fair value over book value in fiscal 2023 decreased approximately in line with the decline in Best Buy’s market capitalization over the same period, \nreflecting the macroeconomic factors that affected our fiscal year 2023 performance and our expectations for the future. Barring a fundamental, material further \ndeterioration of these factors, we believe the risk of future goodwill impairment within our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit is remote. \nOur Best Buy Health reporting unit is subject to a greater level of uncertainty, since it operates in a less mature, rapidly-changing and high-growth environment. In \nboth fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, the excess of fair value over book value for this reporting unit was substantial. In fiscal 2023, the excess decreased more \nsignificantly than our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit, primarily due to the effects of macroeconomic factors, driving, for example, lower forecasted revenue \ngrowth rates in some categories and higher estimates of weighted-average cost of capital rates. The risk of further deterioration in these factors, along with the \nmore uncertain environment in which Best Buy Health operates, cause the likelihood of goodwill impairment for our Best Buy Health reporting unit to be higher \nthan for our Best Buy Domestic reporting unit.\nInventory Markdown\nDescription\nOur merchandise inventories were $5.1 billion as of January 28, 2023. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value through the \nestablishment of inventory markdown adjustments. Markdown adjustments reflect the excess of cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate \nsale or other disposal of inventory and establish a new cost basis. No adjustment is recorded for inventory that we expect to return to our vendors for full credit.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nMarkdown adjustments involve uncertainty because the calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment about the expected \nrevenue and incremental costs we will generate for current inventory. Such estimates include the evaluation of historical recovery rates, as well as factors such \nas product type and condition, forecasted consumer demand, product lifecycles, promotional environment, vendor ",

The level of \nmarkdown adjustments has remained relatively stable over the last three fiscal years.\nTax Contingencies\nDescription\nOur income tax returns are routinely examined by domestic and foreign tax authorities. Taxing authorities audit our tax filing positions, including the timing and \namount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. At any one time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the \nvarious taxing authorities. In evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions, we may record a liability for such exposures. A number of \nyears may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a liability, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. We adjust our liability for \nunrecognized tax benefits and income tax provisions in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the \nrelevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our effective income tax rate is also affected by changes in tax \nlaw, the tax jurisdiction of new stores or business ventures, the level of earnings and the results of tax audits.\n32\n\n\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the \nexposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Such assumptions can include complex and uncertain external factors, such as changes in tax law, \ninterpretations of tax law and the timing of such changes, and uncertain internal factors such as taxable earnings by jurisdiction, the magnitude and timing of \ncertain transactions and capital spending.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nAlthough we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains \nthat could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established \nliability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use \nof our cash and may result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement may reduce our effective income \ntax rate in the period of resolution. See Note 11, Income Taxes, of the Notes to",

We allocate the transaction price to all performance obligations identified in the contract based on their relative \nfair value. For performance obligations provided over the term of the contract, we typically recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring \nprogress over the related contract term. This method involves the estimation of expected usage patterns, primarily derived from historical information.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nThere is judgment in (1) measuring the relative standalone selling price for bundled performance obligations; and (2) assessing the appropriate recognition and \nmethodology for each performance obligation, and for those based on usage, estimating the expected pattern of consumption across a large portfolio of \ncustomers. When insufficient reliable and relevant history is available to estimate usage, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the life of the contract until \nsuch history has accumulated.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nA 10% change in the amount of services membership deferred revenue as of January 28, 2023, would have affected net earnings by approximately $40 million in \nfiscal 2023. The amount of services membership deferred revenue has increased over the last three fiscal years, primarily driven by the national launch of our \nBest Buy Totaltech membership offering, which resulted in higher membership sales and the initial deferral of more revenue than under the previous Total Tech \nSupport offer. \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe do not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material effect on our financial statements.\nItem 7A.

Our cash, cash equivalents and \nrestricted cash generate interest income that will vary based on changes in short-term interest rates.

In \nour opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2023, based on criteria \nestablished in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial \nstatements as of and for the year ended January 28, 2023, of the Company and our report dated March 17, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those \nfinancial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of \ninternal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable \nassurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding \nof internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of \ninternal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit \nprovides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the \npreparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial \nreporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the \ntransactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation \nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in \naccordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of \nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of \neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance \nwith the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nMarch 17, 2023\n38\n\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n$ in millions, except per share amounts\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJanuary 28, 2023\n \nJanuary 29, 2022\nAssets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCurrent assets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n 1,874  \n \n$\n 2,936  \nReceivables, net\n \n 1,141  \n \n \n 1,042  \nMerchandise inventories\n \n 5,140  \n \n \n 5,965  \nOther current assets\n \n 647  \n \n \n 596  \nTotal current assets\n \n 8,802  \n \n \n 10,539  \nProperty and equipment\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLand and buildings\n \n 688  \n \n \n 671  \nLeasehold improvements\n \n 2,260  \n \n \n 2,160  \nFixtures and equipment\n \n 3,928  \n \n \n 5,419  \nProperty under finance leases\n \n 100  \n \n \n 91  \nGross property and equipment\n \n 6,976  \n \n \n 8,341  \nLess accumulated depreciation\n \n 4,624  \n \n \n 6,091  \nNet prope",

Receivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a \nreserve for expected credit losses, which is primarily based on historical collection trends. Our allowances for uncollectible receivables were $30 million and $39 \nmillion as of January 28, 2023, and January 29, 2022, respectively. We had $41 million and $52 million of write-offs in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nMerchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The weighted-average method is used to determine the cost of inventory which \nincludes costs of in-bound freight to move inventory into our distribution centers. Also included in the cost of inventory are certain vendor allowances. Costs \nassociated with storing and transporting merchandise inventories to our retail stores are expensed as incurred and included within Cost of sales on our \nConsolidated Statements of Earnings.\nOur inventory valuation also reflects markdown adjustments for the excess of the cost over the net recovery we expect to realize from the ultimate disposition of \ninventory, including consideration of any rights we may have to return inventory to vendors for a refund, and establishes a new cost basis.

We depreciate property and equipment to its residual value using the straight-line method over the estimated useful \nlives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period from the date the assets are placed in \nservice to the end of the lease term, which includes optional renewal periods if they are reasonably certain. Accelerated depreciation methods are generally used \nfor income tax purposes.\nWhen property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our Consolidated Balance Sheets and any resulting \ngain or loss is reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nRepairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized \nand depreciated.\nCosts associated with the acquisition or development of software for internal use are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the software, \ngenerally from two years to five years. A subsequent addition, modification or upgrade to internal-use software is capitalized to the extent that it enhances the \nsoftware's functionality. Capitalized software is included in Fixtures and equipment on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Software maintenance and training \ncosts are expensed in the period incurred. The costs of developing software for sale to customers are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility is \nestablished, which generally leads to expensing substantially all costs.\nCosts associated with implementing cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts are capitalized using methodology similar to internal-use software, \nbut are included in Other Assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEstimated useful lives by major asset category are as follows (in years):\n \nAsset Category\nUseful Life\nBuildings\n5-35\nLeasehold improvements\n5-10\nFixtures and equipment\n2-20\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When \nevaluating long-lived assets with impairment indicators for potential impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated undiscounted \nfuture cash flows. If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss. The \nimpairment loss calculation compares the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value, which is typically based on estimated discounted future cash \nflows. We recognize an impairment loss if the amount of the asset’s carrying value exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value.\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events on a quarterly basis.

We also monitor other factors when evaluating store locations for impairment, including \nsignificant changes in the manner of use or expected life of the assets or significant changes in our business strategies.\n45\n\n\nWhen reviewing long-lived assets for impairment, we group long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows \nare largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For example, long-lived assets deployed at store locations are reviewed for impairment at \neither the individual store level or at the local market level. Such reviews involve comparing the net carrying value of all assets to the net cash flow projections for \neach store or market. In addition, we conduct separate impairment reviews at other levels as appropriate, for example, to evaluate potential impairment of assets \nshared by several areas of operations, such as information technology systems. \nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2021, we concluded that the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on our store operations was a triggering event to review for potential \nimpairments of our store assets. As a result of this analysis, we recorded an immaterial asset impairment charge for a small number of stores within SG&A. No \nother triggering events were identified for the periods presented.\nLeases\nThe majority of our lease obligations are real estate operating leases used in our retail and distribution operations. Our finance leases are primarily equipment-\nrelated. For any lease with an initial term in excess of 12 months, the related lease assets and liabilities are recognized on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as \neither operating or finance leases at the inception of an agreement where it is determined that a lease exists. We have lease agreements that contain both lease \nand non-lease components. For lease agreements entered into or reassessed after the adoption of Accounting Standard’s Codification 842, Leases, in fiscal \n2020, we have elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on \nour Consolidated Balance Sheets; we recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nOperating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease \npayments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future payments over the lease term at the \ncommencement date. We estimate the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on an evaluation of our credit ratings and the prevailing market rates for \ncollateralized debt in a similar economic environment with similar payment terms and maturity dates",

Our operating \nleases also typically require payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These components comprise the majority of our variable \nlease cost and are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. In instances where they are fixed, they are included due to our election to combine \nlease and non-lease components. Operating lease assets also include prepaid lease payments and initial direct costs and are reduced by lease incentives. We \ngenerally do not include options to extend or terminate a lease unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Fixed payments may contain \npredetermined fixed rent escalations. We recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations. We test goodwill for impairment \nannually in the fiscal fourth quarter or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We monitor the existence of \npotential impairment indicators throughout the fiscal year. We test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are determined by identifying \ncomponents of operating segments which constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment \nmanagement. We have goodwill in two reporting units – Best Buy Domestic and Best Buy Health – with carrying values of $492 million and $891 million, \nrespectively, as of January 28, 2023.\nOur detailed impairment testing involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. Fair value reflects the price a \npotential market participant would be willing to pay for the reporting unit in an arms-length transaction and typically requires analysis of discounted cash flows \nand other market information, such as trading multiples and other observable metrics. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, we conclude \nthat no goodwill impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to \nthe excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nIntangible Assets\nOur valuation of identifiable intangible assets acquired is based on information and assumptions available to us at the time of acquisition, using income and \nmarket approaches to determine fair value, as appropriate.\nWe amortize our definite-lived intangible assets over the estimated useful lives of the assets.

We record an impairment loss for any portion of the carrying value that is not recoverable. \n46\n\n\nDerivatives\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of Canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations on a portion of our net investment in our \nCanadian operations. The contracts have terms of up to 12 months. For a net investment hedge, we recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative as a \ncomponent of foreign currency translation within other comprehensive income to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being \nhedged, until the investment is sold or liquidated. We limit recognition in net earnings of amounts previously recorded in other comprehensive income to \ncircumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. We report the gains and losses, if \nany, related to the amount excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness in net earnings.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nWe utilized “receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate” interest rate swaps to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our $500 million principal amount of \nnotes due October 1, 2028 (“2028 Notes”). Our interest rate swap contracts are considered perfect hedges because the critical terms and notional amounts \nmatch those of our fixed-rate debt being hedged and are, therefore, accounted for as fair value hedges using the shortcut method. Under the shortcut method, \nwe recognize the change in the fair value of the derivatives with an offsetting change to the carrying value of the debt. Accordingly, there is no impact on our \nConsolidated Statements of Earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to recognized receivable and payable \nbalances denominated in non-functional currencies. The contracts generally have terms of up to 12 months. These derivative instruments are not designated in \nhedging relationships and, therefore, we record gains and losses on these contracts directly to our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset \nor liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. To measure fair value, we use a three-tier valuation hierarchy based \nupon observable and non-observable inputs:\nLevel 1 — Unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either d",

In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different \nlevels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value \nmeasurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the \nconsideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability.\nFair value remeasurements are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). Fixed asset fair values are primarily derived using a discounted cash flow \n(“DCF”) model to estimate the present value of net cash flows that the asset or asset group was expected to generate. The key inputs to the DCF model \ngenerally include our forecasts of net cash generated from investment operations, as well as an appropriate discount rate.\nAssets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to our tangible fixed assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, \nwhich are remeasured when the derived fair value is below carrying value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. For these assets, we do not periodically adjust \ncarrying value to fair value, except in the event of impairment. When we determine that impairment has occurred, the carrying value of the asset is reduced to fair \nvalue and the difference is recorded within SG&A and Restructuring charges on our Consolidated Statements of Earnings for non-restructuring and restructuring \ncharges, respectively.\n47\n\n\nInsurance\nWe are self-insured for certain losses related to workers’ compensation, medical, general liability and auto claims; however, we obtain third-party excess \ninsurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain claims. Some of these self-insured losses are managed through a wholly-owned insurance captive.

Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or \nservices is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or \nservices. Our revenue excludes sales and usage-based taxes collected and is reported net of sales refunds, which includes an estimate of future returns and \ncontract cancellations based on historical refund rates, with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales. We defer the revenue associated with any unsatisfied \nperformance obligation until the obligation is satisfied, i.e., when control of a product is transferred to the customer or a service is completed.\nProduct Revenue\nProduct revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical control, either in our stores or at their home. Any fees charged to customers for delivery are a \ncomponent of the transaction price and are recognized when delivery has been completed. We use delivery information to determine when to recognize revenue \nfor delivered products and any related delivery fee revenue.\n48\n\n\nIn most cases, we are the principal to product contracts as we have control of the physical products prior to transfer to the customer. Accordingly, revenue is \nrecognized on a gross basis. For certain sales, primarily activation-based software licenses and third-party stored-value cards, we are the sales agent providing \naccess to the content and recognize commission revenue net of amounts due to third parties who fulfill the performance obligation. For these sales, control \npasses upon providing access of the content to the customer.\nWarranty obligations associated with the sale of our exclusive brands products are assurance-type warranties that are a guarantee of the product’s intended \nfunctionality and, therefore, do not represent a distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract.\nServices - When we are the principal\nWe recognize revenue for services, such as delivery, installation, set-up, software troubleshooting, product repair, and data services once the service is \ncompleted, as this is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits of the service or serviced product.

Payment for the membership \ncontracts is due at the start of the contract period. We have determined that our contracts do not include a significant financing component. For performance \nobligations provided over time, we recognize revenue on a usage basis, an input method of measuring progress over the related contract term. This method is \nderived by analysis of historical utilization patterns as this depicts when customers use the services and, accordingly, when delivery of the performance obligation \noccurs. There is judgment in (1) determining the level at which we apply a portfolio approach to these contracts; (2) measuring the relative standalone selling \nprice for performance obligations within these contracts to the extent that they are only bundled and sold to customers with other performance obligations, or \nalternatively, using a cost-plus margin approach; and (3) assessing the pattern of delivery across multiple portfolios of customers, including estimating current \nand future usage patterns.

We estimate breakage based on historical patterns and other factors, such as laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction. We recognize \nbreakage revenue using a method that is consistent with customer redemption patterns. Typically, over 90% of gift card redemptions (and therefore recognition of \nover 90% of gift card breakage revenue) occur within one year of issuance. There is judgment in assessing (1) the level at which we group gift cards for analysis \nof breakage rates, (2) redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate value of gift cards which we do not expect to be redeemed. Gift card breakage income was $59 \nmillion, $49 million and $33 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021, respectively.\nSales Incentives\nWe frequently offer sales incentives that entitle our customers to receive a gift card at the time of purchase or an instant savings coupon that can be redeemed \ntowards a future purchase.

The revenue allocated to these sales \nincentives is deferred as a contract liability and is based on the cards that are projected to be redeemed. We recognize revenue for this performance obligation \nwhen it is redeemed by the customer or when it is not expected to be redeemed. There is judgment in determining (1) the level at which we group incentives \nbased on similar redemption patterns, (2) future redemption patterns, and (3) the ultimate number of incentives that we do not expect to be redeemed.\nWe also issue coupons that are not earned in conjunction with a purchase of a product or service, typically as part of targeted marketing activities. This is not a \nperformance obligation, but is recognized as a reduction of the transaction price when redeemed by the customer.\nCustomer Loyalty Programs\nWe have customer loyalty programs which allow members to earn points for each purchase completed with us or when using our private label and co-branded \ncredit cards. Points earned enable members to receive a certificate that may be redeemed on future purchases. Certificate expirations are typically two months \nfrom the date of issuance. Our loyalty programs represent customer options that provide a material right and, accordingly, are performance obligations for each \napplicable contract. The relative standalone selling price of points earned by our loyalty program members is deferred and included in Deferred revenue on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheets based on the percentage of points that are projected to be redeemed.

There were no borrowings outstanding \nunder the Five Year Facility Agreement as of January 28, 2023, or January 29, 2022.\nThe interest rate under the Five Year Facility Agreement is variable and is determined at our option as: (i) the sum of (a) the greatest of (1) JPMorgan Chase \nBank, N.A.’s prime rate, (2) the greater of the federal funds rate and the overnight bank funding rate plus, in each case, 0.5%, and (3) the one-month London \nInterbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), subject to certain adjustments plus 1%, and (b) a variable margin rate (the “ABR Margin”); or (ii) the LIBOR plus a variable \nmargin rate (the “LIBOR Margin”). In addition, a facility fee is assessed on the commitment amount. The ABR Margin, LIBOR Margin and the facility fee are \nbased upon our current senior unsecured debt rating. Under the Five Year Facility Agreement, the ABR Margin ranges from 0.00% to 0.225%, the LIBOR Margin \nranges from 0.805% to 1.225%, and the facility fee ranges from 0.07% to 0.15%.

The acquisition of Current Health was for $389 million, and Yardbird was acquired for $79 million. These acquisitions are consistently mentioned across multiple chunks, with specific dates provided: November 2, 2021, for Current Health and November 4, 2021, for Yardbird.\n\n2. **FY2021 and FY2023 Acquisitions**: There is no specific mention of acquisitions made by Best Buy in FY2021 or FY2023. Some chunks mention a minority equity investment in FY2021, but no major acquisitions are detailed for these years.\n\n3. **Additional Information**: There are mentions of acquisition-related transaction costs in FY2022, but no specific acquisitions are noted for FY2023. The document also discusses goodwill and intangible assets, but these do not directly answer the question about specific acquisitions.\n\nBased on this information, we can conclude:\n\n- The information is sufficient to answer the question for FY2022, as we have clear details about the acquisitions of Current Health and Yardbird, including financial details and dates.\n- For FY2021 and FY2023, the information is not sufficient to identify any major acquisitions, as none are mentioned in the outputs. The lack of specific acquisition details for these years suggests that there may not have been any major acquisitions, or they were not covered in the document sections reviewed.\n\nIn summary, Best Buy's major acquisitions in FY2022 were Current Health Ltd. and Yardbird Furniture. There is no evidence of major acquisitions in FY2021 or FY2023 based on the provided outputs."
