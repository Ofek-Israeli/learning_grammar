      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.
