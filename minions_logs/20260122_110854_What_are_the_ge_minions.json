      "prompt": "# Decomposition Round #1\n\nYou (the supervisor) cannot directly read the document(s). Instead, you can assign small, isolated tasks to a less capable worker model that sees only a single chunk of text at a time. Any cross-chunk or multi-document reasoning must be handled by you.\n\n## Your Job: Write Two Python Functions\n\n### FUNCTION #1: `prepare_jobs(context, prev_job_manifests, prev_job_outputs) -> List[JobManifest]`\n- Break the document(s) into chunks (using the provided chunking function, if needed). Determine the chunk size yourself according to the task: simple information extraction tasks can benefit from smaller chunks, while summarization tasks can benefit from larger chunks.\n- Each job must be **atomic** and require only information from the **single chunk** provided to the worker.\n- If you need to repeat the same task on multiple chunks, **re-use** the same `task_id`. Do **not** create a separate `task_id` for each chunk.\n- If tasks must happen **in sequence**, do **not** include them all in this round; move to a subsequent round to handle later steps.\n- In this round, limit yourself to **up to 12 tasks** total.\n- If you need multiple samples per task, replicate the `JobManifest` that many times (e.g., `job_manifests.extend([job_manifest]*n)`).\n\n### FUNCTION #2: `transform_outputs(jobs) -> str`\n- Accepts the worker outputs for the tasks you assigned.\n- First, apply any **filtering logic** (e.g., drop irrelevant or empty results).\n- Then **aggregate outputs** by `task_id` and `chunk_id`. All **multi-chunk integration** or **global reasoning** is your responsibility here.\n- Return one **aggregated string** suitable for further supervisor inspection.\n\n\n\n## Relevant Pydantic Models\n\nThe following models are already in the global scope. **Do NOT redefine or re-import them.**\n\n### JobManifest Model\n```\nclass JobManifest(BaseModel):\n    chunk: str  # the actual text for the chunk of the document\n    task: str  # the actual task instruction for the small model\n    advice: str  # optional, any additional advice on how to perform the task\n\n    chunk_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    task_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n    job_id: Optional[int] = (\n        None  # you do NOT need to set this, it will be handled automatically\n    )\n\n```\n\n### JobOutput Model\n```\nclass JobOutput(BaseModel):\n    explanation: str\n    citation: Optional[str]\n    answer: Optional[str]\n\n```\n\n## Function Signatures\n```\ndef prepare_jobs(\n    context: List[str],\n    prev_job_manifests: Optional[List[JobManifest]] = None,\n    prev_job_outputs: Optional[List[JobOutput]] = None,\n) -> List[JobManifest]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        context (List[str]): A list of documents.

DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store\npromotion and merchandising.\nCustomer Warehouse\nSome of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party\noperated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable,\nand have lower turnover.\nDistributor Networks\nWe distribute many of our products through third-party distributors.  Third-party distributors are particularly effective when\ngreater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our\nfoodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums\nthrough third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators.\nE-commerce\nOur products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-\ncommerce websites and mobile commerce applications.\nIngredients and Other Supplies\nThe principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings,\nflour, juice concentrates, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat.

Through our operations, authorized bottlers,\ncontract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient\nfoods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories.\nAs a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers, customers, and\ncompetitors across the world, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and\nbehaviors; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; a highly competitive operating environment; a\nrapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility,\nincluding the deadly conflict in Ukraine; and an evolving regulatory landscape.\nTo meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ (PepsiCo Positive). pep+ is\na strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will\nstrive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and\npeople. pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling\nproducts in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take\nsustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet.\npep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals\nunder a comprehensive framework:\n•\nPositive Agriculture: We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of\nland, an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint, sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and\nimprove the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain. In 2022, we elevated a number of external\nstrategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus, including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland\nCompany (ADM) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains, up to 2 million acres; a research\nagreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture\npractices; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability, new substra",

In 2022, we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings\ndelivered through reusable models from 10% to 20% by 2030. Additionally, we are making progress on our diversity,\nequity and inclusion journey around the world. And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000\nemployees to make a positive impact in their communities through our global workforce volunteering program, One\nSmile at a Time.\n•\nPositive Choices: We continue working to evolve our portfolio of convenient food & beverage products so that they are\nbetter for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing products,\nprioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category;\naccelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio; and\noffering more products with healthier oils. We are also continuing to scale new business models that require little or no\nsingle-use packaging, including the iconic SodaStream, already sold in more than 45 countries, and the new SodaStream\nProfessional platform, allowing users to personalize their choices in reusable containers at home or on the go.\nWe believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth.\nSee also “Item 1A.

Many of the commodities used in the production and\ntransportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and\nwe manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments,\nincluding swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic,\nthe inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions\n31\n\n\nTable of Contents\n(including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation, labor and\ncommodity availability and costs.

These new or increased legal or\nregulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and\nadditional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or\nincreased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on\nour business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which\nour products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the\nunfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations.\nRisks Associated with International Operations\nWe are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations.

These taxes and regulations vary in scope\nand form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages\nwith a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g.,\nplastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling\nrates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging.\nWe sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the\nproducts we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction.\nBecause of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their\npackaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results.

For example, as part of risk updates to the Board\nand relevant Committees during 2022, the Board or its relevant Committee were provided updates on the impact of\ndisruptive events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, COVID-19 and supply chain disruption and commodity inflation.\nThe Board also receives periodic updates from external experts and advisers on global macroeconomic trends and\nconditions that may impact the Company’s strategy and financial performance, including geopolitical conflicts, economic\ninstability, labor market trends, changing consumer behavior, retail disruption and digitalization.\nThe Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and\nthe Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters.\n◦\nThe Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’s risk\nmanagement and oversight processes, and assists the Board’s\n34\n\n\nTable of Contents\noversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo.

At the end of 2022, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10%\ndecrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2022 by $176 million, which\nwould generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases.\nForeign Exchange\nOur operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue in 2022, with Mexico, Russia,\nCanada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net\nrevenue in 2022. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are\nmade, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign\nsubsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During\n2022, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Turkish\nlira, euro, Egyptian pound, British pound sterling and South African rand, partially offset by an appreciation of the Russian ruble.\nCurrency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results.\nIn addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made,\nmanufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine,\nand currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or\nincreased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating\nenvironments.\n36\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December  31, 2022 and $2.",

We believe volume\nprovides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and\nprovides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer\nlevel. Beginning in 2022, unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes.\nFurther, our fiscal 2022 results include an additional week (53  reporting week). Unit volume growth excludes the impact of the\n53  reporting week.\nBeverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-\nowned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling\noperations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by\nour noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents\n(CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all\nbeverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing\nof product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on\nBCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of\nour beverage products.

The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of\nfuture changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.

We have discussed our critical\naccounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee.\n(a)\n(b)\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nOur critical accounting policies and estimates are:\n•\nrevenue recognition;\n•\ngoodwill and other intangible assets;\n•\nincome tax expense and accruals; and\n•\npension and retiree medical plans.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and\nsales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is\nalso when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that\ndo not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace\ndamaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they\nexpect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a\nresult, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry\npractices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days\ninternationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\nWe estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility,\nwrite-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and ",

In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with\ncustomer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks,\nwe monitor customer inventory levels.\nAs discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to\ncustomers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing\nactivities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to\ncustomers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new\nproducts, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include\nsupport provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\nA number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on\nannual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur\nafter year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar\nprograms and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance\nlevels.

If these indefinite-lived brand criteria\nare not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the\nexpected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market\nshare, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the\nmacroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.\nIn connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights\nto manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights,\nmany factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these\nfranchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these\nfranchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these\nfranchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived.

We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more\nfrequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment,\nfirst we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include\nmacroeconomic conditions (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost\nenvironment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and\nsignificant changes in the brand or reporting unit.

Significant\nmanagement judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including\nthose related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high\n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\ninterest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions\nused in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including\nperpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are\nconsistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our\nresults. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our\nBusiness Risks.”\nIn 2022, we recorded $1.3  billion ($1.1  billion after-tax or $0.78 per share) of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment\ncharges related to the SodaStream brand in Europe. As a result, its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 is equal to its fair\nvalue and the brand is at a heightened risk of future impairment if certain assumptions and estimates were to change. For\nexample, a mutually exclusive 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate and a 100-basis-point decrease in the perpetuity\ngrowth rate used to estimate the fair value of the SodaStream brand would result in an additional estimated impairment charge of\napproximately $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively.

Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated\nfinancial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax\nreturn but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements.\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIn 2022, our annual tax rate was 16.1% compared to 21.8% in 2021. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information.\nSee Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nPension and Retiree Medical Plans\nOur pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined\nbased on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also\neligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share\nof retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing\nthe remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits.\nSee “Items Affecting ",

Annual pension and retiree\nmedical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working\nduring the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and\n(3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on\nassets for our funded plans.\nSignificant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include:\n•\ncertain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\n•\nthe expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans;\n•\nthe spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities;\n•\nfor pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and\n•\nfor retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates.\nCertain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All\nactuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a\ncurtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact\non the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations.\nAt each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with\nmaturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the\ndiscount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and\namount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities.\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’\ninvestment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given\nyear do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return.\n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is\nbased on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care\nindustry. Our review of the trend ",

In addition, we expect the recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, partially offset by\nhigher discount rates, to increase our pension and retiree medical expense in 2023.\nSensitivity of Assumptions\nA decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our\nbenefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would\nindividually increase 2023 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows:\nAssumption\nAmount\nDiscount rates used in the calculation of expense\n$\n13 \nExpected rate of return\n$\n38 \nFunding\nWe make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in\naccordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the\nemployee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be\ncurrently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these\nplans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these\nbenefits.\nWe made a discretionary contribution of $125 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2023 and expect to make\nan additional $125 million in the third quarter of 2023.\nOur pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest\nrates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate\ndifferent opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans.

Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual\nexpense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses.\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nPension and Retiree Medical Expense\nPension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between\nthe fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7\nis reflected in corporate unallocated expenses.\nDerivatives\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural\nproducts, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market\neach period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected\nin division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions\nrealize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in\ncorporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading\nor speculative purposes.\nNet Revenue and Operating Profit/(Loss)\nNet revenue and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows:\n \nNet Revenue\nOperating Profit/(Loss)\n \n2022\n2021\n2020\n2022\n2021\n2020\nFLNA\n$\n23,291 \n$\n19,608 \n$\n18,189 \n$\n6,135 \n$\n5,633 \n$\n5,340 \nQFNA\n3,160 \n2,751 \n2,742 \n604 \n578 \n669 \nPBNA\n26,213 \n25,276 \n22,559 \n5,426 \n2,442 \n1,937 \nLatAm\n9,779 \n8,108 \n6,942 \n1,627 \n1,369 \n1,033 \nEurope\n12,724 \n13,038 \n11,922 \n(1,380)\n1,292 \n1,353 \nAMESA \n6,438 \n6,078 \n4,573 \n666 \n858 \n600 \nAPAC \n4,787 \n4,615 \n3,445 \n537 \n673 \n590 \nTotal division\n86,392 \n79,474 \n70,372 \n13,615 \n12,845 \n11,522 \nCorporate unallocated expenses\n— \n— \n— \n(",

Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and\nsales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is\nalso when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are\naccounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling,\ngeneral and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we\nexclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue\nproducing transactions.\nThe transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of\nreturn. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date\nproducts from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy\nfor certain warehouse-distributed products\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\nis to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and\nout-of-date products.\nOur products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry\npractices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days\ninternationally, and may allow discounts for early payment.\nWe estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility,\nwrite-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the\nexpected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and\nprojections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers.\nWe are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit\nissues with these customers. In 2022, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately 14% of our\nconsolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by\nthem to Walmart.\nTotal Marketplace Spend",

Total marketplace spending\nincludes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as\npayments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote\nlower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of\nadvertising and other marketing activities.\nA number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on\nannual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur\nafter year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar\nprograms and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance\nlevels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in\nearnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on\nannual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\nThe terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term\nestimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers\nunder these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue,\nand the remaining balances of $242 million as of December 31, 2022 and $262 million as of December 25, 2021 are included in\nprepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet.\nFor interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our\ninterim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our\nforecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as\napplicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim\nperiod, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that\nthey are identified.

If the qualitative assessment indicates that\nit is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.\nIn the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair\nvalue of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using\ndiscounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with\nmanagement’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of\nassumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant\nmanagement judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including\nthose related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of\nsales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and\ngoodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are\nbased on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration\nin these assumptions could adversely impact our results.\nAmortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic\nenvironment.

We currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in\n2023.\nThe TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax\nincome (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election\nof either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such\ntaxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when\nincurred.\nOther Tax Matters\nIn 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both\nagreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals\nconference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for\nuncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the\nmandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $112 million ($0.08 per share) in\n2021.\nIn 2022, we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The\nagreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any\ncorrelating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit\nof $233 million ($0.17 per share) in 2022. Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues.\nOn August 16, 2022, the “Inflation Reduction Act” (H.R. 5376) was signed into law in the United States. We do not currently\nexpect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective\ntax rate or on our liquidity.\nOn May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF),\neffective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes.

We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax\nreturn positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not\nsucceed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the\nprogress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements.

PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under\nthe shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives\nbased on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination\nthereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been\ngranted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-\nterm cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets.\nThe Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options\nand the vesting of RSUs and PSUs.\nAs of December 31, 2022, 37 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP.\nThe following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and\nadministrative expenses, and excess tax benefits",

This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two\nyears.\nMethod of Accounting and Our Assumptions\nThe fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to\nemployees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the\ndate that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition,\nwe use historical data to estimate\n85\n\n\nTable of Contents\nforfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest.\nWe do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require\nshareholder approval under the LTIP.\nStock Options\nA stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee\nstock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense\nat the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date\nof grant and generally have a 10-year term.\nOur weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows:\n2022\n2021\n2020\nExpected life\n7 years\n7 years\n6 years\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.9 %\n1.1 %\n0.9 %\nExpected volatility\n16 %\n14 %\n14 %\nExpected dividend yield\n2.5 %\n3.1 %\n3.4 %\nThe expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical\nexperience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life.\nVolatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend\nyield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and\nstock price.\nA summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows:\nOptions\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise\n\nPrice\nWeighted-\nAverage\nContractual\n\nLife Remaining\n\n(years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at December 25, 2021\n10,142  $\n110.54 \nGranted\n2,422  $\n163.54 \nExercised\n(1,578) $\n87.33",

Pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by\ncontributions to defined contribution plans.\nIn 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from Plan A to Plan I,\neffective January 1, 2022. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. There was no material impact\nto pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction.\nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants,\neffective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the\neffective date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of\nservice regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee\ncontributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $70 million in 2021,\nprimarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses.\nIn 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of\ncertain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H),\neffective January 1, 2021. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization facilitated a\nmore targeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility.\nThere was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reorganization.\nIn 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan\nH. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service\ncost expense.\nGains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual and\nexpected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date.

Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are\navailable to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due.

Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan\nassets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return\nexpectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to\nreduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future\ndate and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards.\nFor 2023 and 2022, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.4% and 6.7%, respectively.

Ongoing productivity initiatives involve\nthe identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of\nderivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include\nfixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.\nOur hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain\nderivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not\nqualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging\ninstrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item\nimpacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction\naffects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur,\n97\n\n\nTable of Contents\nwe immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2022 were not material.\nCash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating\nactivities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with\nthe underlying hedged item.\nCredit Risk\nWe perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of\ncredit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of\nour counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of\nfinancial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk.\nCertain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability\nposition if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on\ncredit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls b",

This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase\norders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply\nof certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers.

Such\nprocedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial\nstatements.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation\nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate\nopinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSales incentive accruals\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through\nvarious programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the\nneed to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current\nliabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding\ncustomer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and\ncomplex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference\nbetween when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer\nand consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical\nexperience and trends.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related\nto (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance\nlevels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical\nperiods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales\nincentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2)\nrecalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis,\n111\n\n\nTable of Contents\nbased on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales\nincentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tes",

The carrying value\nof indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 was $32.5 billion which represents 35% of total assets, and\nincludes PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value\nof $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2022.\nWe identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and the SodaStream\nbrand in Europe as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive\noperating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of\nthese indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’s forecasted revenue\nand profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied\nto the projected cash flows.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite-lived assets impairment process,\nincluding controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth\nrates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the\nCompany’s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods.\nTo assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual\nresults. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other\ninternal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating\n(1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to\nthe respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local\ncountries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were\nindependently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed ",

The Company establishes reserves if it believes\nthat certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though\nthe Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well\nas the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court\nrulings or tax authority settlements.\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the\napplication of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment.\nSuch judgments impact both the timing and amount of\n112\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthe reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax\nreturns in light of new information.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter.

We have summarized certain portions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-\nLaws below. The summary is not complete. The Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws are incorporated by reference as exhibits\nto the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this exhibit is a part. You should read the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws for\nthe provisions that are important to you.\n\n\nGeneral\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 3,600,000,000 shares of common stock, par value one and two-thirds\ncents (1-2/3 cents) per share. As of February 2, 2023, there were 1,377,251,316 shares of common stock outstanding which were\nheld of record by 98,573 shareholders.\nVoting Rights. Each holder of a share of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held of record on the\napplicable record date on each matter submitted to a vote of shareholders. Action on a matter generally requires that the votes\ncast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast in opposition. A plurality vote is required in an election of the Board of Directors\nwhere the number of director nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected.\nDividend Rights. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends as may be declared from time to time by\nPepsiCo’s Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor.\nRights Upon Liquidation. Holders of our common stock are entitled to share pro rata, upon any liquidation, dissolution or\nwinding up of PepsiCo, in all remaining assets available for distribution to shareholders after payment or providing for PepsiCo’s\nliabilities.\nPreemptive Rights. Holders of our common stock do not have the right to subscribe for, purchase or receive new or\nadditional common stock or other securities.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nComputershare Trust Company, N.A. is the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock.\n2\n\n\nStock Exchange Listing\nThe Nasdaq Global Select Market is the principal market for our common stock, where it is listed under the symbol\n“PEP,” and our common stock is also listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.\nCertain Provisions of PepsiCo’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws; Director Indemnification Agreements\nAdvance Notice of Proposals and Nominations. Our By-Laws provide that shareholders must provide timely written\nnotice to bring business before an annual meeting of shareholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at an annual\nmeeting of shareholders. Notice for an annual meeting is generally timely if it is received at our principal office not less than\n90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year’s annu",

However, if the date of the\nannual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days or delayed more than 60 days from this anniversary date, or if no annual\nmeeting was held in the preceding year, such notice by the shareholder must be delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to\nthe annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the 90th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth\nday following the day on which public announcement of the date of such annual meeting was first made. Shareholders utilizing\n“proxy access” must meet separate deadlines. The By-Laws also specify the form and content of a shareholder’s notice. These\nprovisions may prevent shareholders from bringing matters before an annual meeting of shareholders or from nominating\ncandidates for election as directors at an annual meeting of shareholders.\nProxy Access. Our By-Laws contain “proxy access” provisions which give an eligible shareholder (or a group of up to 20\nshareholders aggregating their shares) that has owned 3% or more of the outstanding common stock continuously for at least\nthree years the right to nominate the greater of two nominees and 20% of the number of directors to be elected at the applicable\nannual general meeting, and to have those nominees included in our proxy materials, subject to the other terms and conditions of\nour By-Laws.\n3\n\n\nSpecial Meetings. A special meeting of the shareholders may be called by the Chairman of the Board, by resolution of the\nBoard or by our corporate secretary upon written request of one or more shareholders holding shares of record representing at\nleast 20% in the aggregate of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote at such meeting. Any such special meeting called at\nthe request of our shareholders will be held at such date, time and place (if any) as may be fixed by our Board, provided that the\ndate of such special meeting may not be more than 90 days from the receipt of such request by the corporate secretary. The By-\nLaws specify the form and content of a shareholder’s request for a special meeting.\nIndemnification of Directors, Officers and Employees. Our By-Laws provide that unless the Board determines otherwise,\nwe shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law, any person who was or is, or who is threatened to be made, a party to an\naction, suit or proceeding (including appeals), whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or arbitrative, by reason of the\nfact that such person, such person’s testator or intestate, is or was one of our directors, officers or employees, or is or was serving\nat our request as a director, officer or employee of another enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments,\nfines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such action, suit or\nproceeding.

We will not be liable for payment of any liability or expense incurred by\nan independent director on account of acts which, at the time taken, were known or believed by such director to be clearly in\nconflict with our best interests.\nCertain Anti-Takeover Effects of North Carolina Law\nThe North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act generally requires the affirmative vote of 95% of a public corporation’s\nvoting shares to approve a “business combination” with any entity that a majority of continuing directors determines beneficially\nowns, directly or indirectly, more than 20% of the voting shares of the corporation (or ever owned, directly or indirectly, more\nthan 20% and is still an “affiliate” of the corporation) unless the fair price provisions and the procedural provisions of the North\nCarolina Shareholder Protection Act are satisfied.\n“Business combination” is defined by the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act as (i) any merger, consolidation or\nconversion of a corporation with or into any other entity, or (ii) any sale or lease of all or any substantial part of the corporation’s\nassets to any other entity, or (iii) any payment, sale or lease to the corporation or any subsidiary thereof in exchange for securities\nof the corporation of any assets having an aggregate fair market value equal to or greater than $5,000,000 of any other entity.\nThe North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act contains provisions that allowed a corporation to “opt out” of the\napplicability of the North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act’s voting provisions within specified time periods that generally\nhave expired. The Act applies to PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods.\nThis statute could",

The Plan is intended as a nonqualified unfunded\ndeferred compensation plan for federal income tax purposes. For purposes of the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Plan is structured as two plans. The portion of the Plan that provides benefits\nbased on limitations imposed by Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”) is intended to be an “excess\nbenefit plan” as described in Section 4(b)(5) of ERISA.

(the “Company”) established the PepsiCo Executive Income Deferral Program (the “Plan”) in 1972 to permit\neligible executives to defer certain cash awards made under its executive compensation programs. Deferrals under the Plan that\nwere earned and vested on or before December 31, 2004 are governed by a separate set of documents that set forth the pre-\nSection 409A terms of the Plan (the “Pre-409A Program”). The terms of the Plan that are applicable to deferrals that are subject\nto Section 409A, i.e., generally, deferred amounts that are earned or vested after December 31, 2004 (the “409A Program”) are\ngoverned by this document. This document sets forth the 409A Program and is effective as of January 1, 2005 (the “Effective\nDate”). Except as otherwise provided herein, this document reflects the provisions in effect from and after January 1, 2005, and\nthe rights and benefits of individuals who are Participants in the Plan from and after that date (and of those claiming through or\non beh",

For purposes of the preceding sentence,\nthe term “actions and events” shall include all distribution trigger events and dates. The rights and benefits with respect to\npersons who only participated in the Plan prior to January 1, 2005 shall be governed by the applicable provisions of the Pre-409A\nProgram documents that were in effect at such time, and shall not be governed by the 409A Program documents.\n    Together, the documents for the 409A Program and the documents for the Pre-409A Program describe the terms of a single\nplan. However, amounts subject to the terms of the 409A Program and amounts subject to the terms of the Pre-409A Program\nshall be tracked separately at all times. The preservation of the terms of the Pre-409A Program, without material modification,\nand the separation between the 409A Program amounts and the Pre-409A Program amounts are intended to permit the Pre-409A\nProgram to remain exempt from Section 409A, and the administration of the Plan shall be consistent with this intent.\n        This document for the 409A Program was most recently restated effective as of January 1, 2022 (with later effective dates\nfor certain provisions).

For purposes of ERISA, the Plan is intended to be a plan described in Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3) and 401(a)(1) of\nERISA providing unfunded benefits to a select group of management or highly compensated employees.\n \n1\n\n\nARTICLE II\n– DEFINITIONS\n    When used in this Plan, the following underlined terms shall have the meanings set forth below unless a different meaning is\nplainly required by the context:\n2.01\nAccount:\nThe account maintained for a Participant on the books of his or her Employer to determine, from time to time, the\nParticipant’s interest under this Plan.

In addition, in this case the Participant’s current Second\nLook Election must delay the payment of the Participant’s deferral to a new Specific Payment Date that is at least five\nyears after the original (or if applicable, last subsequently elected) Specific Payment Date.\n        (2)    If a Participant’s initial election specified payment based on the Participant’s Separation from Service, the\nParticipant may only make a Second Look Election if the election is made at least 12 months before the Participant’s\nSeparation from Service and the Participant separates from Service for Retirement. In addition, in this case the\nParticipant’s Second Look Election must delay the payment of the Participant’s deferral for at least five years. For\nexample, the Second Look Election must delay the payment of the Participant’s deferral to a Specific Payment Date that\nturns out to be at least five years after the later of (i) the Participant’s Separation from Service or (ii) the last designated\nperiod following the Participant’s Separation from Service that was designated in a prior Second Look Election.\nAlternatively, th",

A Participant’s deferral shall be credited\nas of the date of the deferral to his or her Account as soon as administratively practicable following the date the compensation\nwould be paid in the absence of a deferral. A Participant’s Account is a bookkeeping device to track the value of the Participant’s\ndeferrals (and his or her Employer’s liability therefor). No assets shall be reserved or segregated in connection with any Account,\nand no Account shall be insured or otherwise secured.\n        (b)    Account Earnings or Losses. As of each Valuation Date, a Participant’s Account shall be credited with earnings and\ngains (and shall be debited for expenses and losses) determined as if the amounts credited to his or her Account had actually been\ninvested as directed by the Participant in accordance with this Article (as modified by Section 5.05, if applicable)",

Each of a Participant’s Deferral Subaccounts shall be invested on a phantom basis in any combination of\nphantom investment options specified by the Participant (or following the Participant’s death, by his or her Beneficiary) from\nthose offered by the Plan Administrator for this purpose from time to time. The Plan Administrator may discontinue any phantom\ninvestment option with respect to some or all Accounts, and it may provide rules for transferring a Participant’s phantom\ninvestment from the discontinued option to a specified replacement option (unless the Participant selects another replacement\noption in accordance with such requirements as the Plan Administrator may apply).\n        (b)    Phantom Investment Options. The basic phantom investment options offered under the Plan are as follows:\n            (1)    Phantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund. Participant Accounts invested in this phantom option are adjusted to reflect\nan investment in the PepsiCo Common Stock Fund, which is offered under the PepsiCo Savings Plan (or such similar plan\nas may be offered by the Company from time to time).

A Participant’s interest in the\nPhantom PepsiCo Common Stock Fund is valued as of a Valuation Date (or a Distribution Valuation Date) by multiplying\nthe number of phantom units credited to the Participant’s Account on such date by the NAV of a unit in the PepsiCo\nCommon Stock Fund on such date.

An amount deferred or transferred into this option is credited with the applicable rate of\nreturn beginning with the date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this option by the Plan Administrator.\n        (3)    Other Funds. From time to time, the Plan Administrator shall designate which (if any) other investment options\nshall be available as phantom investment options under this Plan. These phantom investment options shall be described in\nmaterials provided to Participants from time to time. Any of these phantom investment options shall be administered\nunder procedures implemented from time to time by the Plan Administrator. Unless otherwise specified in these materials\nor procedures, in the case of any such phantom investment option that is based on a unitized fund, an amount deferred or\ntransferred into such option is converted to phantom units in the applicable fund of equivalent value by dividing such\namount by the NAV of a unit in such fund on the Valuation Date as of which the amount is treated as invested in this\noption by the Plan Administrator.

Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products.

However, given its global nature and involvement in various financial activities such as acquisitions and financing, it can be inferred that PepsiCo operates globally.\nCitation: Although no specific geographies were mentioned as primary locations of operation for PepsiCo as of FY2022, it can be inferred that PepsiCo operates globally due to its use of terms such as 'acquisitions' and 'financing activities' which suggest a multinational presence.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: PepsiCo operates globally as indicated by its sensitivity to foreign exchange translation. This suggests that it has a significant presence across various geographies.\nCitation: Impact of foreign exchange translation\nAnswer: PBNA (presumably Pepsi Bottling North America) and Europe divisions\nExplanation: This answer focuses on sections discussing business operations and regional performance. It identifies PBNA and Europe as geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022.\nCitation: We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions.\nAnswer: Global (no specific mention of geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022)\nExplanation: There's no specific mention of geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022.

Specifically, it discusses impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand in Europe.\nCitation: As a result, its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 is equal to its fair value and the brand is at a heightened risk of future impairment if certain assumptions and estimates were to change. For example, a mutually exclusive 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate and a 100-basis-point decrease in the perpetuity growth rate used to estimate the fair value of the SodaStream brand would result in an additional estimated impairment charge of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively.\nAnswer: United States and Canada\nExplanation: This answer was derived from a section discussing business operations and regional performance.\nCitation: Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees.\nExplanation: No specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpt.\nAnswer: United States\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022, a mention of 'U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan' suggests that PepsiCo has a significant presence in the United States.\nCitation: In 2022, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered pre-tax settlement charges for certain U.S defined pension plans.\nAnswer: Global; however, specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022 include North America (United States), Latin America (Mexico), Europe (United Kingdom), and Asia (China).\nExplanation: This answer was derived by analyzing sections discussing business operations and regional performance.

This inference aligns with common knowledge about PepsiCo's business operations.\nCitation: As of December 31, 2022, there was $396 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants.\nExplanation: No specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpts.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: PepsiCo primarily operates globally as there is no specific mention of regional operations or market presence. However, it's worth noting that there might be some regional data or performance metrics discussed elsewhere in the document.\nCitation: Note 1 — Share-Based Compensation Data\nAnswer: U.S. and U.K.\nExplanation: This snippet indicates that Pepsico has defined benefit plans in the U.S. Additionally, another snippet mentions a change to a U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective March 31, 2022.\nCitation: In 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from Plan A to Plan I, effective January 1, 2022.\nAnswer: U.S. and International\nExplanation: This table lists financial information for PepsiCo's pension and retiree medical plans by geography (U.S. and International) for various years.\nCitation: Pension\nRetiree Medical\n\nU.S.\nInternational\n\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\n2022\n2021\nAnswer: U.S. and International\nExplanation: This answer can be inferred from the table that lists 'U.S.' and 'International' as separate columns for pension and retiree medical benefit costs. This suggests that PepsiCo operates primarily in these two geographies.\nCitation: Pension\nRetiree Medical\n\nU.S.\nInternational\n\n\n\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2022\n2021\n2020\nService cost\n$487\n$518\n$434\n$64\n$104\n$86\n$37\n$33\n$25\nOther pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense:\nInterest cost\n$434\n$324\n$435\n$90\n$74\n$85\nAnswer: U.S. and International\nExplanation: Based on the table discussing weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation for our pension and retiree medical plans.

However, it implies a global presence with operations in both U.S. and international markets.\nCitation: Our contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans include a discretionary contribution of $125 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan and non-discretionary contributions of approximately $90 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans.\nAnswer: United States and internationally\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of Pepsico's operations, we can infer that Pepsico operates internationally based on the presence of 'International plan assets' and 'Equity securities' and 'Government securities' and 'Corporate bonds' and 'Fixed income commingled funds' and 'Contracts with insurance companies' and 'Cash and cash equivalents' under this section. Additionally, Pepsico also operates within the United States as indicated by 'U.S. plan assets'.\nCitation: International plan assets\nEquity securities \n1 $1,291 \n$2,232\nGovernment securities \n2 736 \n1,053\nCorporate bonds \n2 254 \n400\nFixed income commingled funds \n1 628 \n632\nContracts with insurance companies \n3 27 \n43\nCash and cash equivalents\n1 75 \n34\nSub-total international plan assets\n3,011 \n4,394\n\nAnswer: U.S.\nExplanation: This section discusses U.S. plan assets for 2022 and 2021, indicating that PepsiCo primarily operates in the U.S. geography.\nCitation: (c) U.S. plan assets for 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although this snippet mentions international debt and borrowings from external parties, it doesn't specify particular geographies. However, it implies that PepsiCo operates globally. Additionally, there's no other section that mentions specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates. Therefore, we can infer that PepsiCo primarily operates globally.\nCitation: As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, our international debt of $304 million and $38 million, respectively, was related to borrowings from external parties, including various lines of credit.\nAnswer: Global (with specific mention of international consolidated subsidiaries and operations in South Africa)\nExplanation: PepsiCo operates globally with a significant presence internationally. This can be inferred from their mention of international consolidated subsidiaries and specific operations in South Africa.\nCitation: Also in 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $1.3 billion, from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund our acquisition of Pioneer Foods.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 are not directly stated, it can be inferred that Pepsico has a global presence due to its global purchasing programs.\nCitation: Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements.\nAnswer: Multiple geographies\nExplanation: This statement suggests that Pepsico operates across multiple geographies to manage its supply chain risk.\nCitation: We mitigate risk to our supply of certain raw materials through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers.\nExplanation: No specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpt.\nAnswer: United States\nExplanation: This snippet mentions that PepsiCo entered into an agreement with Celsius to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States. This implies that PepsiCo primarily operates in this geography as of FY2022.\nCitation: In 2022, we entered into an agreement with Celsius to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States (see Note 4 for further information)\nExplanation: No specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpts.\nAnswer: Global operations with specific mentions of Russia and Mexico.\nExplanation: This statement suggests that PepsiCo has a significant presence in these countries and that currency fluctuations affect their financial performance.\nCitation: Currency translation adjustment primarily reflects depreciation of the Russian ruble and Mexican peso.\nAnswer: Egypt and Mexico\nExplanation: This answer can be inferred from the section discussing currency translation adjustments. Although it doesn't directly mention Pepsico's primary operating geographies, it mentions specific currencies (Egyptian pound and British pound sterling) that likely correspond to countries where Pepsico operates. Given that Mexico's currency (Mexican peso) was also listed earlier as a currency with significant depreciation, it's reasonable to infer that Pepsico may have a significant presence in Mexico. Egypt's presence can be inferred from its currency being listed as well.\nCitation: Currency translation adjustment primarily reflects depreciation of the Egyptian pound and British pound sterling.\nAnswer: North America and Europe\nExplanation: This information can be found in Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures under the section discussing the Juice Transaction.\nCitation: In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $3.5 billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe.\nAnswer: Europe and South Africa\nExplanation: This answer was derived from sections discussing regional performance. Specifically, we see that there is a 'Europe' section under 'PBNA' and 'Corporate' categories. Additionally, we see that PepsiCo acquired Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa.\nCitation: Europe\nPBNA\nEurope\nCorporate\nTotal\nPepsiCo\nProvision\nfor income\ntaxes\nNet income\nattributable to\nPepsiCo\nImpact on net\nincome\nattributable to\nPepsiCo per\ncommon share\nGain associated with the Juice\nTransaction\n$ (3,029)\n$ (292)\n$ — \n$ (3,321)\n$ 433 \n$ (2,888)\n$ 2.08 \nAcquisition and divestiture-related\ncharges\n51\n14\n6\n71\n(13)\n58\n(0.04)\nOperating profit\n$ (2,978)\n$ (278)\n$ 6 \n$ (3,250)\n420\n$ (2,830)\n$ 2.04 \nOther pension and retiree medical\nbenefits income \n(10)\n3\n(7)\n0.01\nTotal Juice Transaction\n$ (3,260)\n$ 423 \n$ (2,837)\n$ 2.04 \n(a) Includes $186 million of deferred tax expense related to the recognition of our investment in TBG.\nAnswer: South Africa and China\nExplanation: I identified South Africa and China as the geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 by focusing on sections discussing business operations and regional performance. Specifically, I looked for mentions of countries where Pepsico has acquired or operates businesses.\nCitation: s, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa.

On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online convenient food companies in China...\nAnswer: AMESA (Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific), Europe, FLNA (Latin America), PBNA (North America)\nExplanation: To identify and list the geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022, I focused on sections discussing business operations and regional performance. I looked for mentions of specific regions or divisions that indicate PepsiCo's market presence. I identified AMESA (Africa), APAC (Asia Pacific), Europe, FLNA (Latin America), and PBNA (North America) as geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates.\nCitation: Juice Transaction, AMESA $3 $10 $173\nBe & Cheery\nAPAC $— $4 $7\nExplanation: No specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpt.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022, the fact that they have a 'Consolidated Balance Sheet' and 'Consolidated Statements of Income' suggests a global presence. Additionally, there's no mention of regional performance or market presence that would indicate a focus on a specific geography.\nCitation: Table of Contents\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although this snippet doesn't directly mention Pepsico's geographies of operation, it implies that Pepsico operates globally as it mentions audits conducted according to PCAOB standards. However, this snippet doesn't provide specific geographies. A more detailed search of Pepsico's annual report or other documents would be necessary to determine specific geographies of operation.\nCitation: We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.\nExplanation: No specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpt.\nAnswer: Europe\nExplanation: This snippet mentions that Pepsico has a presence in Europe through its SodaStream brand.\nCitation: We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and the SodaStream brand in Europe as a critical audit matter.\nAnswer: United States and certain foreign jurisdictions\nExplanation: This answer was determined by focusing on sections discussing business operations and regional performance. In this case, Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements mentions that Pepsico's global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions.\nCitation: As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although specific geographies are not listed, it can be inferred that PepsiCo operates globally due to its business model of granting exclusive contracts to independent bottlers within a specific geographical area.\nCitation: Independent bottlers: customers to whom we have granted exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographical area.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although no specific geographies were mentioned, the use of 'global' indicates that Pepsico operates worldwide.\nCitation: These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of specific geographies where Pepsico operates, 'Global' suggests a worldwide presence.\nCitation: Our Global Code of Conduct is distributed to all employees and is available on our website at http://www.pepsico.com.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Since no specific geographies were mentioned as Pepsico's primary operating locations as of FY2022, we can infer that Pepsico operates globally based on its 'Global Code of Conduct'.\nCitation: f our Global Code of Conduct\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022, it's reasonable to infer that PepsiCo operates globally given its inclusion of consolidated financial statements for multiple years and its presence as a multinational corporation.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Since no specific sections discussing business operations, market presence, or regional performance were identified within the given document excerpt for Pepsico's geographies of operation as of FY2022, it can be inferred that Pepsico operates globally.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022, it's reasonable to infer that PepsiCo operates globally given its presence in various forms (e.g., Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These forms suggest a wide range of activities and transactions across different periods and regions.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Since no specific sections discussing business operations, market presence, or regional performance were identified within the given document excerpt, it can be inferred that PepsiCo primarily operates globally as of FY2022. This inference is based on the lack of regional-specific information within the document.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Pepsico's operations and market presence were discussed across various sections but no specific geographies were highlighted as primary. This suggests that Pepsico operates globally.\nCitation: No specific geographies were mentioned as Pepsico primarily operates. However, it can be inferred from general statements.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022, it's reasonable to infer that PepsiCo operates globally given its involvement with international entities such as 'Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc.' and its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This suggests a multinational presence.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: No specific geographies were identified as of FY2022. However, based on general knowledge about PepsiCo's operations, it can be inferred that they primarily operate globally. Since no specific regional performance or market presence was discussed in the given document excerpt, this answer relies on external knowledge.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: No specific geographies were mentioned as Pepsico's primary operation locations. However, given that Pepsico's plans and agreements were filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 10-K for various fiscal years, it can be inferred that Pepsico operates globally.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: PepsiCo's inclusion of global financial statements suggests its presence across various geographies.\nCitation: 101. ...the Consolidated Statements of Income...for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022...which implies that PepsiCo operates globally.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of specific geographies where PepsiCo primarily operates as of FY2022, it can be inferred that PepsiCo operates globally due to its registration of securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This implies a significant presence across various regions.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: United States and Switzerland\nExplanation: This answer can be inferred from the fact that PepsiCo's common stock is listed on two exchanges: Nasdaq Global Select Market (in the United States) and SIX Swiss Exchange (in Switzerland).\nCitation: Stock Exchange Listing\n\n...and our common stock is also listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022, it can be inferred that Pepsico has a global presence given that its By-Laws mention 'annual general meeting' which suggests a global scope. However, this answer might be too broad or indirect. A more direct answer could be obtained if we had access to Pepsico's annual report for FY2022.\nCitation: Our By-Laws specify the form and content of a shareholder’s notice.\nAnswer: North Carolina\nExplanation: Although this section primarily discusses anti-takeover effects of North Carolina law and its impact on PepsiCo's business operations, it indirectly reveals that PepsiCo operates primarily within North Carolina as it mentions 'PepsiCo since we did not opt out within these time periods' referring to North Carolina Shareholder Protection Act.\nCitation: Certain Anti-Takeover Effects of North Carolina Law\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: PepsiCo's global presence and operations across multiple regions and markets suggest that it primarily operates globally. This conclusion is based on the fact that they have filed registration statements with the SEC covering various regions and markets.\nCitation: DESCRIPTION OF NOTES We have previously filed a registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-177307), which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 13, 2011 and covers the issuance of the 2026 notes...\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022, it can be inferred that Pepsico has a global presence given its listing on multiple stock exchanges (Nasdaq Stock Market) and issuance of notes denominated in different currencies (€ and £). This suggests that Pepsico operates across various regions and countries.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: This section mentions that Pepsico has issued global notes that are registered with Euroclear and Clearstream Banking. This suggests that Pepsico has a global market presence and operates across multiple geographies.\nCitation: Global Notes. ... deposited with or on behalf of a common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V., or its successor, as operator of the Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”)\nAnswer: Europe (specifically member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency) and New York/London (mentioned as cities where banking institutions operate)\nExplanation: This answer focuses on sections discussing market presence or regional performance. Although it's unclear which company this document belongs to (PepsiCo or another company), it mentions specific geographies where payments may be made or received. These geographies include Europe (specifically member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency) and New York/London (mentioned as cities where banking institutions operate).\nCitation: If the euro is unavailable to us due to the imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond our control or if the euro is no longer being used by the then member states of the European Monetary Union that have adopted the euro as their currency or for the settlement of transactions by public institutions of or within the international banking community...\nAnswer: United States (referenced through New York City) and United Kingdom (referenced through London City)\nExplanation: This document appears to be a financial agreement or contract related to bond issuance. It mentions specific cities (New York City and London City) as locations where banking institutions operate. These cities can be associated with the United States and United Kingdom geographies. Therefore, it can be inferred that PepsiCo primarily operates in these regions as of FY2022.\nCitation: The term “business day” with respect to the euro notes means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, (1) which is not a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or the City of London are authorized or required by law or executive order to close and (2) on which the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross Settlement Express Transfer system (the TARGET2 system), or any successor thereto, operates.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: No specific geographies were mentioned as Pepsico's primary operation locations. However, based on general knowledge and assuming this document pertains to Pepsico's financial operations (as it discusses redemption prices and government bond rates), it can be inferred that Pepsico operates globally.\nCitation: No specific geographies were mentioned as Pepsico's primary operation locations. However, based on general knowledge and assuming this document pertains to Pepsico's financial operations (as it discusses redemption prices and government bond rates), it can be inferred that Pepsico operates globally.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Pepsico's operations and market presence aren't specified by geography. Therefore, it can be inferred that Pepsico primarily operates globally.\nCitation: No specific geography was mentioned as Pepsico primarily operates. However, it's implied that Pepsico operates globally as there's no mention of regional operations.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Since no specific sections discussing business operations, market presence, or regional performance were found for Pepsico's geographic regions as of FY2022, it can be inferred that Pepsico operates globally.\nCitation: No specific geographic regions were mentioned as Pepsico's primary operation locations.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Pepsico's operations and market presence were not specified in the given document excerpt. However, considering Pepsico's status as a multinational corporation with a diverse portfolio of brands and products, it can be reasonably assumed that Pepsico primarily operates globally.\nCitation: No specific geographic regions were mentioned as Pepsico's primary operation areas. However, based on general knowledge about Pepsico's business operations as of FY2022, it can be inferred that Pepsico primarily operates globally.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Pepsico's operations and market presence were not discussed in the given document excerpt. Therefore, I relied on general knowledge that Pepsico operates globally with a significant presence in various regions.\nCitation: No specific geography was mentioned as Pepsico primarily operates. However, based on general knowledge and common understanding of Pepsico's business operations.\nExplanation: No relevant information about Pepsico's geography of operation was found in the given document excerpt.\nAnswer: United States\nExplanation: Although this snippet of text appears to be discussing tax implications and governmental charges, it indirectly suggests that PepsiCo primarily operates within the United States. This inference comes from the fact that it mentions 'the United States' as a specific geography where taxes and charges would be imposed.\nCitation: to any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed by the United States or a taxing authority in the United States\nAnswer: United States\nExplanation: Although this snippet of text appears to be discussing tax exemptions for a financial instrument (notes), it mentions 'the United States' as a party to an agreement. This implies that PepsiCo has a significant presence or operation within this geography.\nCitation: to which the United States is a party as a precondition to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;\nAnswer: United States\nExplanation: Although this snippet appears to be discussing tax-related exemptions and withholding rules for Pepsico's notes, it indirectly implies that Pepsico primarily operates within the United States. This conclusion is based on the fact that tax-related exemptions and withholding rules often pertain to a company's home country or primary market.\nCitation: h the United States (other than a connection arising solely as a result of the ownership of the notes, the receipt of any payment or the enforcement of any rights hereunder),\nAnswer: United States\nExplanation: Section (1) mentions 'the United States' as a reference point for determining tax implications on note holders. This suggests that Pepsico operates primarily within this geography.\nCitation: Although no direct mention of Pepsico's geography of operation was found in the given document snippet, it can be inferred from section (1) that Pepsico has a significant presence in the United States.\nExplanation: No specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 were identified in the given document excerpt. However, it appears to be a section discussing tax withholding and exemptions for note holders.\nAnswer: United States\nExplanation: Although this document appears to be related to financial and tax matters regarding a series of notes issued by an entity (likely a company), it provides a definition of 'United States' which includes 'the states of the United States and the District of Columbia and any political subdivision thereof'. This suggests that PepsiCo primarily operates within this geography.\nCitation: As used under this heading “—Payment of Additional Amounts” and under the heading “—Redemption for Tax Reasons,” the term “United States” means the United States of America (including the states of the United States and the District of Columbia and any political subdivision thereof)\nExplanation: No specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpt.\nAnswer: United States of America and/or District of Columbia\nExplanation: This section discusses consolidation and merger requirements for Pepsico's business operations. It mentions that any successor must be organized and validly existing under the laws of any state of the United States of America or the District of Columbia. This implies that Pepsico primarily operates within these geographies.\nCitation: •    we will be the surviving corporation or, if not, that the successor will be a corporation that is organized and validly existing under the laws of any state of the United States of America or the District of Columbia and will expressly assume by a supplemental indenture our obligations under the indenture and the notes;\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Since no specific geographies were discussed in relation to PepsiCo's business operations or market presence within the given document excerpt, it can be inferred that PepsiCo operates globally.\nCitation: No specific geographies were mentioned in the given document excerpt.\nExplanation: No specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpt.\nExplanation: No specific geographies where Pepsico primarily operates as of FY2022 were mentioned in the given document excerpt.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Since there's no specific mention of Pepsico's primary operation locations within the given document snippet, we can't pinpoint exact geographies. Nonetheless, as a multinational corporation like Pepsico typically operates globally, it's reasonable to assume that they have a significant presence worldwide.\nCitation: No specific geographies were mentioned as Pepsico's primary operation locations. However, based on general knowledge and typical corporate structures, it can be inferred that Pepsico operates globally.\nAnswer: Europe\nExplanation: This section discusses how investors can hold interests in Pepsico's notes through Clearstream or Euroclear in Europe.\nCitation: You may hold your interests in the global notes in Europe through Clearstream or Euroclear...\nAnswer: Belgium\nExplanation: This address suggests that PepsiCo (or its subsidiary) has a presence in Belgium.\nCitation: s 1 Boulevard Roi Albert II, B-1210 Brussels, Belgium.\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although this snippet doesn't directly mention Pepsico's geographic operations, it implies that Pepsico has a global presence as it mentions 'global notes'.\nCitation: o continue as depositary for the global notes and a successor is not appointed within 90 days;\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although there's no explicit mention of Pepsico's primary operating geographies as of FY2022 within the provided document snippet, it can be inferred that Pepsico operates globally given its international presence and multiple amendments to its retirement plan. However, for a more accurate answer, I would recommend consulting Pepsico's official annual reports or recent news articles for more up-to-date and specific information.\nCitation: None\nAnswer: Global\nExplanation: Although this snippet doesn't directly mention specific geographies where PepsiCo operates, it implies a global presence by mentioning 'international employees' and 'home countries'. This suggests that PepsiCo has a significant presence across multiple countries.\nCitation: Effective January 1, 2011, the Corporation established a new defined contribution structure (the “DC Program”) to benefit selected international employees for whom it has been determined to be appropriate (i.e., employees on assignments outside of their home countries for whom it is judged to be impracticable to have them participate in their home country retirement plans and employees who are among a selected group of senior globalists on United States tax equalized packages).\nAnswer: United States and its territories\nExplanation: Although this section discusses 'Associated Companies', it implies that PepsiCo primarily operates within the United States and its territories.
